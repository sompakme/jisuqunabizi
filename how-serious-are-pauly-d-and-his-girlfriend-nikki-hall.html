Swiftly finding chemistry with <strong>Pauly</strong> but ultimately being booted from the show during the finale, Hall would return for the second season of Double Shot at Love, this time sparking a deeper connection with Pauly (despite a rough start) which found the two reality stars officially dating by show’s end. But just how serious are these two? Celebrity couples are always a hot committee, but their lasting power is always a crap shoot.</p><h2 id=how-it-all-started-for-pauly-d-and-nikki-hall><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How It All Started For Pauly D And Nikki Hall</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The future reality show couple first met on the set of Double Shot at Love, with Hall being a contestant</a>. Falling for the DJ almost immediately,<strong> Nikki</strong> was so smitten with DelVecchio that she even admitted to being in love during an episode of Double Shot, which featured a lie detector test being administered by former Jersey Shore cast members <strong>JWoww</strong> and<strong> Ronnie Ortiz-Magro</strong>. However, it was not in the cards for Nikki (at that time) and Pauly as the DJ would leave the show a single man and Nikki would make her exit without Pauly.</p><h2 id=lsquo-the-situation-rsquo-thinks-nikki-is-lsquo-the-one-rsquo-for-pauly-d><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>‘The Situation’ Thinks Nikki Is ‘The One’ For Pauly D</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Pauly D</strong> has enjoyed the single life for quite some time; however, the Jersey Shore star has seemingly come close to bidding his bachelor a fond farewell (an example of such being <a href=#>the very brief fling with<strong> JWoww</strong>; however, the jury’s still out on whether DelVecchio actually had feelings for her</a>). But this time, things are different, at least according to <strong>“The Situation.”</strong> Mike Sorrentino stated on an episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vaccation that not only does he suspect that Nikki Hall is ‘The one’ but that she is also a welcomed member to the Jersey Shore family. According to People.com, “The Situation” had this to say, “"I thought<strong> Nikki</strong> was a natural. She did great. You could just tell the way that she is with<strong> Pauly</strong> — like, this is the one, probably. Quite possibly, Nikki and Pauly could be the next Jersey Shore family wedding."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is The Reason Pauly D’s Hair Hasn’t Moved Since 2003</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-relationship-is-popular-enough-to-perhaps-be-get-its-own-spin-off-show-despite-the-couple-rsquo-s-private-nature><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Relationship Is Popular Enough To Perhaps Be Get Its Own Spin-off Show, Despite The Couple’s Private Nature</span></h2><p>Though fans of the couple seem to be very interested in the possibility of a spin-off show featuring the couple exclusively, both <strong>Pauly D</strong> and<strong> Nikki </strong>seem to value their privacy too much for that particular show to come to fruition. Hall herself has even made it clear that she enjoys being a “guest star’ and not a feature star of her own show. So, at least for the foreseeable future, fans will have to be content with watching the couple’s antics on future episodes of the Jersey Shore.</p><h2 id=pauly-says-lsquo-things-have-been-great-rsquo-and-he-rsquo-s-lsquo-happy-rsquo><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Pauly Says ‘Things Have Been Great’ And He’s ‘Happy’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The past few years have been anything but bright for just about everyone, given the circumstances (cough… COVID… cough); however, that hasn't stopped<strong> Pauly D</strong> from on only keeping his eye on the future regarding his career (<a href=#>he couldn’t wait to launch a DJ party, just last year</a>), but also making it known that the world’s current setbacks haven't affected his relationship with Hall. Indeed,<strong> DelVecchio</strong> has stated that he and Hall have grown closer during the pandemic. According to People.com, The Jersey Shore star had this to say, "The pandemic gave us a chance to focus on our relationship, and we were able to actually film, too,’ he continued, “It's cool to bring her along because she's friends with my Jersey Shore family as well now, and their family. So, it's been great. It's been a good time, and we're just taking it day by day. We're happy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Pauly D’s Girlfriend Is Repping ‘Jersey Shore’ In Her Recent Makeup Tutorial Post</a></span></p><h2 id=pauly-d-is-already-referring-to-nikki-hall-as-lsquo-wifey-rsquo><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Pauly D Is Already Referring to Nikki Hall As ‘Wifey’</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pauly D</strong> has already started to refer to Nikki as “wifey,’ </a>which has delighted the couple’s fans. This should, of course, be taken with a grain of salt, as this is not a concrete sign that both DelVecchio and Hall are ready to tie the knot just yet. ‘Wifey’ has been a simple term of endearment for your special someone for quite some time, and does by no means signify future wedding bells. Fans will have to continue to wait to see if <strong>Pauly </strong>and<strong> Nikki</strong> will be moving to the next level, at least a little while longer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-marriage-on-the-horizon-for-pauly-d-and-nikki-hall><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Is Marriage On The Horizon For Pauly D And Nikki Hall?</span></h2><p>With all signs pointing to (or at least hinting at) the couple engaged (despite an absence of a ring on Hall’s finger), it seems the couple are poised to make it official. However, an engagement is not, all but certain nor does it mean marrage is in the future. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is <strong>Pauly D </strong>actually ready to get married? Well, he has left some rather ambiguous words for fans of the couple regarding the future of their relationship</a>. According to Page Six, Pauly had this to say, “Who knows what the future holds?” Pauly continued, “we’re just taking it day by day. We have nothing set in stone, and we just really enjoy each other’s company at the moment.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>It's 2020 And DJ Pauly D Is Still All About 'GTL'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmq2crnqlec2ioqShXZ2urbiMo5yrq5WuerS0zqucZquVp7awwdJmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
