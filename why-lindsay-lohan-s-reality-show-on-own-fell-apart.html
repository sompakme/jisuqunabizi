While the actress starred in many popular movies, she has fallen pretty far in recent years. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">behaved badly on The Canyons movie set</a>&nbsp;and her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV reality series was canceled</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, eight episodes of a show called&nbsp;Lindsay&nbsp;aired on OWN, and fans got the chance to see the star in her late 20's, living her life. But instead of leading to much success and many seasons, the show only got those eight episodes and some not-so-great press.</p><p>Let's take a look at why Lindsay&nbsp;fell apart.</p><h2 id=lindsay>'Lindsay'</h2><p>Fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wonder if Lindsay Lohan will have a 2021 comeback</a>, and her show on OWN was meant to be a comeback, too.</p><p>Fans of Lindsay Lohan's were excited to see her&nbsp;on a raw and real documentary-style show. She seemed to want to show viewers what her life was really like: according to&nbsp;Vulture, she said in the third episode,&nbsp;“I signed up for something to just [have] a camera just be there, not a reality show. No offense to the Kardashians. They do a great job with theirs, but I don’t ever want to be that.”</p><p>But the show fell apart, and when Oprah and Lohan sat together to discuss Lohan's life, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oprah said, "You need to cut the bull***t."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oprah said, "I believe that you believe that this is your time to turn this around for yourself." She continued, "You know what to do. What I really feel deeply from you, profoundly, that you don't just have head intelligence. You have heart intelligence.&nbsp;Phenomenal things are going to come from you if you don't&nbsp;continue to block them."</p><p>The real problem with the reality show? Lohan was often late for filming or said that she didn't want to film that day, so that changed the whole production schedule.</p><p>Oprah mentioned this and said that she didn't want to hear about all of these delays. She said to Lohan, "keep your commitments."</p><p>A production schedule is definitely everything for any TV show or movie, so it sounds like it was pretty tough to keep it going.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Were Lindsay Lohan And Nicole Richie Really Friends?" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Were Lindsay Lohan And Nicole Richie Really Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-s-life>Lindsay's Life</h2><p>The eight episodes followed Lindsay Lohan as she was on her sober journey. According to&nbsp;Variety, she had just gone to rehab for the sixth time, and viewers watched her move into an apartment in New York City. She also had a sober coach who she often talked to.</p><p>Mostly, viewers noticed that Lohan's life seemed very messy, and in one scene, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lohan yelled at her assistant</a> because she was trying to sort through her clothes when moving into her new apartment. She wanted her assistant, Matt to fold and organize the clothes, and she was very upset that it wasn't done.</p><p>If the star was trying to be relatable and let people into her world more, this was a tough moment, as it's hard to feel bad for someone who wants others to fold her clothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was another major scene that gave viewers pause: Lohan had a photoshoot for&nbsp;Elle Indonesia&nbsp;and she was so late that&nbsp;the entire schedule&nbsp;had to be altered. The big problem was Lohan didn't go on the first day of the shoot, and since that meant missing natural light,&nbsp;that meant that everyone had to scramble.</p><p>Lohan didn't seem upset that she had changed the schedule. When talking to the camera, she said that she has often acted as a co-stylist on photo shoots and that she deserves credit for that.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Everything We Know About The Paris Hilton And Lindsay Lohan Feud" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About The Paris Hilton And Lindsay Lohan Feud</a></span></p><h2 id=what-critics-thought>What Critics Thought</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What did critics think of&nbsp;Lindsay?&nbsp;The Washington Post&nbsp;shared the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"5 most upsetting moments" in the first episode</a>&nbsp;and mentioned that when Lohan had the chance to star in a short film that was promoting a brand of lingerie, she decided not to do it. The article says, "Only once she finds out they want her to be involved in actual scenes with dialogue rather than a photoshoot, she angrily decides to drop out. The reason? They lied to her about her role, and she doesn’t trust liars. She acknowledges that she only agreed just so she could be on a set again — but that environment wasn’t good for her 'sobriety or sanity.'"</p><p>This is definitely confusing to hear, especially since Lohan kept saying that she wanted to get back to work and have people see her as a talented actress.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="Is Lindsay Lohan Still Close To Her Mother, Dina Lohan?" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Lindsay Lohan Still Close To Her Mother, Dina Lohan?</a></span></p><p>Obsever.com&nbsp;called the show "exploitative" and mentioned that it seemed like Lohan was doing this show so she could be in the public eye again and OWN would get ratings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While people tuned in as they were curious about how Lindsay Lohan was doing, it doesn't sound like it could have gone for more than eight episodes.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Mesmerized By Lindsay Lohan’s Recent Beach Selfie</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdobavsNKasGakn52ur7%2BMq5yapJmpxm6%2Fx6iuZqeeYry4uoyfnKWkXZa9or7TaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
