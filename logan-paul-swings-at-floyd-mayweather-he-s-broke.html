He gets these big checks, doesn't pay the taxes on it and then the IRS comes hunting him down later,” He continued. “He owes a lot of people I know money and Logan's deep down on that list. So, I don't know if Logan's ever gonna get paid, it's kinda f**ked up."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Logan Paul Reveals How He Got Scammed Out Of $3.5 Million</a></span></p><p>Recently, UFC legend Chael Sonnen also weighed in on the situation. Sonnen, widely regarded as one of the greatest trash-talkers in MMA history, urged Floyd him to get ahold of Paul's people and pay up "before the FBI gets called in to look at the issue.”</p><p>"Big problem for Floyd if he received funds, and he did. So, this story is going to be ongoing. But if you are team Floyd, you are gonna wanna lawyer up real fast,” hve said. “You're gonna want to make a deal and you're gonna want to pay Logan Paul."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For what it’s worth—<a href=#>Logan doesn’t sound too upset that the boxer stiffed him</a>. After Floyd showed up to an NBA game draped in platinum and gold chains, Logan quipped: “That’s my check!”</p><p>“I don’t really like stressing too much about seeing my check around his neck. But like I’m coming after one of those chains or two, trust,” he joked.</p><p>Floyd's brother even commented on the situation—telling Fred Talks Fighting that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Logan do deserve to get paid."</a></p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Logan Paul Wears World's Most Expensive Pokémon Card At WrestleMania</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportskeeda</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5sLPAp2SpmaWherTDyKeerGWRqXqnuM6ym2alka7Epq3ToZyrZZiawG6u0aiinmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
