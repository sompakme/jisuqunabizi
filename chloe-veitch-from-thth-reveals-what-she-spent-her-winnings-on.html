"I don't think England and America ever had a war. So I genuinely believe that I'm gonna win over the hearts of the Americans," and that she did!</p><p>While Chloe placed second on the social media-inspired series, she was a finalist on THTH, taking a piece of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the $75,000 grand prize!</a> Although it was distributed amongst the entire group of hotties, Veitch still managed to walk away somewhat richer than when she arrived.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an exclusive interview with TheThings, Chloe revealed that she was actually quite smart with her money, having put it into savings! When asked what she did with her winnings and if she splurged on anything special, Chloe had to dig deep.</p><p>"I can’t actually remember what I’ve done with it. What did I do with it? It’s been two years!" she said, however, she's certain she put it into savings. Luckily for Chloe, those savings came in handy this year when she got her hands on her dream car!</p><p>"I recently just bought my dream car, a Range Rover!" she revealed. In addition to a car, Chloe is also investing in a flat, making it clear that she's an "independent woman now!" Veitch told TheThings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Exclusive: Chloe Veitch Reveals Her Most And Least Genuine Alliances On 'The Circle'</a></span></p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-chloe-veitch>What's Next For Chloe Veitch?</h2><p>While fans were excited to spot Chloe Veitch return to their screen on The Circle, they are becoming antsy when it comes to what Chloe has in store next!</p><p>As she keeps in touch with her former THTH co-star, Nicole O'Brien, and her The Circle pals, Lee, Savannah, and of course, Mitchell, we could easily be seeing her make more friends during her first trip over to the United States this month!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although she couldn't share too much, Chloe made it clear that she is heading over to American soil to work on a number of projects. "I promise, anyone listening to this, there is something coming, and you’re going to be shell shocked," Chloe told TheThings, later confirming that she is headed to the U.S where she will stay for "a good few days working on a couple of projects," Chloe said.</p><p>Will it be a film?
