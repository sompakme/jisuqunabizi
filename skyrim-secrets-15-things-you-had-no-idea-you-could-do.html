For years now. people have been putting hundreds and maybe even thousands of hours into their characters and completing quests, and why not? When a game is cool, then it really is worth putting all of those hours into -- if you're a gamer, that is. Once, a very wise man said in the general chat of&nbsp;World of Warcraft, "Anyone&nbsp;who plays this game less than me is a noob, and anyone&nbsp;who plays it more than me has no life."&nbsp; It certainly is hard to argue with logic like that, and the players&nbsp;of&nbsp;Skyrim&nbsp;come at it much the same way. But at some point, when you play a game like&nbsp;Skyrim&nbsp;a lot, you simply just run out of things to do, am I right? Well, no. In actuality, you don't.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you think that you've done all there is to do in this game, then think again.&nbsp;The developers at Bethesda may have been born at night, but it wasn't last night. They have all sorts of unmarked quests for you to do to keep you busy at&nbsp;Skyrim.&nbsp;Just when you thought you might have to go back to school or get a job, you find out you have more to do. Your mom and your girlfriend&nbsp;can thank me later.</p><p>Here are&nbsp;15 Things You Didn't Know You Could Do in Skyrim.</p><h2 id=marriage-speedrun><strong>Marriage Speedrun</strong></h2><p>We know that so much of the point of this game is how long you play it, not how fast you are at it, but with that said, sometimes, a speedrun can get the juices flowing, and one of the most fun ways of doing that is the marriage speedrun. This could've changed since this writing, but from what I can find, "right now, the fastest anyone has ever gotten married in Skyrim is in 3:37, and the title is held by Twitch streamer 5exual_Tyrannosaurus. The lucky spouse is none other than Marcurio of Riften." So there you go. What are you waiting for? If you don't have anything to do, then get busy trying to get married as fast as you can. Lord knows that isn't going to happen IRL (In Real Life for you nongamers) because of how much&nbsp;Skyrim&nbsp;you play.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=arcwind-point><strong>Arcwind Point</strong></h2><p>When you play this game long enough, you soon realize that there are many different lands for you to explore, which is one of the reasons that this game is so awesome. It's hard to get bored when you keep having new things to check out. Arcwind point is one of the coolest areas to find and to explore even though it can be a tad bit dangerous. But if you do go and check it out, you might want to wait until you hit level 78, as then, when you're cruising around collecting dragon shouts, a rare and legendary dragon will appear, high up on the ruins. If you're running out of things to do, you might want to go over and check him out. It's really is a cool thing to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angie-s-camp><strong>Angie's Camp</strong></h2><p>Angie's&nbsp;Camp is a fun thing to do if you're looking to max out your archery. You'll find Angie at a small camp in the mountains, and that's where she'll tell you a tearjerker of a story and then offers to train you in archery. Obviously, you could care less and go on your way. Just kidding! If you have an archery score of 94 or more, you can hit 100 level really quickly if you do this, which is really hard to do, as anyone who focuses on archery knows. So, it might be worth it to head on up to the mountains and listen to Angie's tale of woe. Nothing in life is for free, so come on.... be nice to Angie when you visit her camp. I promise that it'll be worth it.</p><h2 id=kagrenzel><strong>Kagrenzel</strong></h2><p>Kagrenzel is a Dwaemer ruin, which houses a lot of Falmer. If you didn't know, "the Falmer are twisted, evil creatures that dwell in Skyrim's deepest reaches. They have but one desire -- to destroy the surface world and any who dwell above." They sound cool, right? Well, maybe they don't, but Kagrenzel actually is. This is a fun dungeon to play and includes a really long and really fun free fall through a tunnel when a floor gives way. Of course, a lot of experienced players have checked this one out already, but there are a lot of players who never have. If you're one of those players, go check out Kagrenzel. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the Falmer.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=frostflow-lighthouse><strong>Frostflow Lighthouse</strong></h2><p>Well, this one is kind of a drag, but what would a game like this be if there wasn't a lot of tragedy going on? It isn't like you're playing Candy Crush, for crying out loud. The backstory goes that a family bought a lighthouse because they wanted to retire in Skyrim. This probably sounded like a good idea at the time, but when you enter the lighthouse, you see that something pretty awful has gone down. There's blood everywhere, and it seems that the Falmer has kidnapped and killed the family. Alright, so why the heck would someone want to retire in a secluded lighthouse near where the Falmer hang out? I just don't get it. Well, at least, through the ensuing quest, you can get some measure of revenge. Maybe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dragon-bridge-hidden-cave><strong>Dragon Bridge Hidden Cave</strong></h2><p>Now, why would you call something by the name "Dragon Bridge"? Everyone knows that dragons can fly. Is it just for lazy dragons or something? I digress. Near Dragon Bridge is an unmarked quest. You'll find a&nbsp;car, a dead horse,&nbsp; a dead woman, and a dead man. Nearby, you'll find some journals that explain what happens. This is what makes games like this so awesome. In the real world, if you were to come across a couple of dead bodies and a dead horse, you would run like crazy, but here, in&nbsp;Skyrim,&nbsp;you're going to read the journals and find out what you're supposed to do to set things right even if it doesn't result in finishing up anything in your journal. Just do what's right!</p><h2 id=forgotten-names><strong>Forgotten Names</strong></h2><p>The College of Winterhold has had some disappearing students. If you've played this game at all, you may have already known that, but what you may not know about is that there's an unmarked quest that has to do with it. You get the quest from Phinis Gestor. He'll tell you about what went down, but he won't actually give you a quest, so you can miss this one if you aren't careful. He'll give you the names of four players -- Rundi, Borvir, Ilas-Tei, and Yisra -- whom you then go look for. The results of what you find might not please you all that much unless you get a kick out of looting corpses. Wait, you don't get a kick out of looting corpses, do you? Gross.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=darklight-tower><strong>Darklight Tower</strong></h2><p>Another cool place for you to check out when you're playing&nbsp;Skyrim&nbsp;is Darklight Tower. Upon entering the tower, you soon find one of your allies fighting a witch who's threatening to turn her mother into a Hagraven, which is a cross between an old crone and a bird. Obviously, you don't want that to happen, so you join the fight. This is a very fun and short dungeon to do and is another thing in&nbsp;Skyrim&nbsp;that a lot of people don't know about, but now, you do. So, the next time someone calls you a noob, a newb, or even a nub, you can break this little quest out for them and ask them if they've done it. It's a super fun quest worth doing if you haven't checked it out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-abandoned-prison><strong>The Abandoned&nbsp;Prison</strong></h2><p>The abandoned prison is, well, a prison that was abandoned, but you probably guessed that from the title. This is an unmarked quest and one that you'll totally enjoy if you go to check it out. The quest involves a whole slew of ghosts and a plot involving the former guards and prisoners that were at the prison. If you like solving mysteries and doing quests that not everyone knows about, I would suggest going over to Eastmarch and checking out the Abandoned Prison -- unless, of course, you're afraid of ghosts. Then, maybe, you want to just go around collecting alchemy ingredients and avoiding this hidden quest. I'm just kidding; check it out. You won't be disappointed.</p><h2 id=ironbind-barrow><strong>Ironbind Barrow</strong></h2><p>Ironbind Barrow is a dungeon that's between Dawnstar and Winterhold. Inside it resides a boss called "Warlord Gathrik," who happens to be the most powerful Draugr in all of the land. It takes a while to get here, and you do want to wait until you level up a bit as the area around it can be treacherous, but this is truly a fun quest to do if you have the time and the inclination. Wait a minute. Who am I kidding? You play&nbsp;Skyrim,&nbsp;and to top it all off, you're actually now reading an article about&nbsp;Skyrim. Of course you have the time and the inclination. Just take my word for it, and check this one out. You won't be sorry that you did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ebony-warrior><strong>Ebony Warrior</strong></h2><p>Everyone&nbsp;who plays&nbsp;Skyrim&nbsp;knows about The Ebony Warrior, but the thing is, not a lot of players actually see him because the requirements are so high. But once you do get the requirements down, "a warrior encased in ebony armor will approach you in any of the major cities and challenge you to a duel to the death. He will await you at his Last Vigil, a camp located on the slopes of the Velothi Mountains in the Rift region of Skyrim, far to the east, just above Fallowstone Cave." The Ebony Warrior isn't a piece of cake, so don't get too discouraged if he wipes the floor with you over and over. And hey, if he does, at least you have something to keep you busy for a while.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-treasure-hunt><strong>The Treasure Hunt</strong></h2><p>There's treasure everywhere in&nbsp;Skyrim.&nbsp;Pretty much every time you're cruising around in a cave or a dungeon, there will be something for you to loot, which really brings us to the question: is everyone in&nbsp;Skyrim&nbsp;a thief? Well, that's probably an issue to bring up another day, but while you're kicking around looking for things of value, don't forget&nbsp;The Great Skyrim Treasure Hunt. There are eleven different maps that are all around that you can find that can lead you to treasure. So, what are you waiting for? Go find those maps, and start looking for things to loot because what fun is it being an adventurer if you aren't going through someone else's stuff and taking it?</p><h2 id=collect-unique-items><strong>Collect Unique Items</strong></h2><p>Okay, so now, it's time to let your freak flag fly. Are you a total&nbsp;Skyrim&nbsp;nerd, or aren't you? Because if you are, there are just a whole lot of unique items that you can find to deck out your character or your character's home. You could be out there collecting everything from armor, to a war horn, to a really funky spoon. Again, this is where you really start to figure out who's totally into it and who's just rolling around having fun. Some people will play for hours, days -- I don't know -- maybe even months trying to find that one rare and unique item that hasn't been within their grasp, and those are the people&nbsp;who really make gaming go around. If you want to collect things like this, you'll never get bored.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bugs-in-jars><strong>Bugs in Jars</strong></h2><p>Bugs in jars might not sound like something that'll make you particularly excited, but I'm here to tell you that you're wrong. These have caused many players to lose their minds trying to figure out what the deal is with them. There are five different types of bugs in jars that you can collect&nbsp;(Butterfly, Dartwing, Moth, Bee, and Torchbug), and players of the game have long spent hours and days trying to figure out the significance of them. There are all sorts of conspiracy theories as to what these bugs in jars actually mean, and of course, there are some people&nbsp;who say they don't mean anything at all. If you're done with a lot of other things in the game,&nbsp;go get these bugs, and try to figure them out for yourself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-more-forgotten-names><strong>And More Forgotten Names</strong></h2><p>We've already mentioned one unmarked quest that was about forgotten names. How about another? In this one, once again, you have to try and find out what happened to a bunch of College of Winterhold students who've gone missing. When you find their rings, they summon up&nbsp;Dremora pirate Velehk Sain, who tries to bargain with you around a treasure. There are two options here: kill him or go along with his bargain. In one way, you get the treasure, and in another, you don't. What should you do? Kill a pirate, or trust his deal and see if he gives you the treasure? Check it out for yourself in this unmarked quest that's sure to be a good time.</p><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp;kotaku.com;&nbsp;elderscrolls.wikia.com;&nbsp;ign.com</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWaso6mntq550p6aq52kqHpygYytn6Kml6h6urvUZp%2BanF2jvG61w56YZrGfqnqku9Slm2acn2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
