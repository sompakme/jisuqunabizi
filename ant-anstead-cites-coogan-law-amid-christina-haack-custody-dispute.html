Anstead’s Instagram followers <a href=#>were subsequently confused</a> to see that the California resident was able to share photos of Hudson while Hall was not allowed to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ant-Anstead-Reveals-Why-He-Can-Post-Photos-of-Son-Hudson-But-Ex-Christina-Haack-Cant-A-Legal-Anomaly-01.jpg><p class=p1>“It’s actually an interesting legal anomaly that I am seeking to change. While Coogan’s law protects kids it doesn’t cover ‘reality’ TV or social media,” the&nbsp;<i>For the Love of Cars&nbsp;</i>alum — who’s been dating <a href=#><strong>Renee Zellweger</strong> </a>since June 2021 — wrote via Instagram comment, referring to <a href=#>the California law that requires a portion of child actors’ earnings to be set aside</a> in a protected trust account. “I’ve been working on a secret project that dives into this.”</p><p class=p1>He added in a second comment: “Hudson <a href=#>will see a father protecting him when he had no voice</a>, his childhood is not for sale. … As a parent, I have no worry in shouldering the cost to protect him.”</p><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>confirmed last month that the&nbsp;<i>Celebrity IOU: Joyride&nbsp;</i>host filed a new declaration amid his and Hall’s custody dispute, alleging that Hudson’s involvement in <a href=#>the HGTV star’s Instagram ads and TV programs</a> were detrimental to his well-being.</p><p class=p1>“The risks for a child working on a television production set (even if that ‘set’ is Christina’s home) are innumerable and well documented,” Anstead — who shares<a href=#>&nbsp;two older children with ex-wife&nbsp;<strong>Louise Storey</strong></a>&nbsp;— <a href=#>wrote in the September court documents</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Putting aside the obvious pressures of working within a TV production environment, children involved in television production often have lingering issues that affect their welfare, worldview, and self-image, leaving them diminished and dependent upon the perceived approval of others for their self-worth.”</p><p class=p1>He continued: “It is my goal to ensure that Hudson is allowed a childhood that is joyful, healthy, and natural, with as few stresses as possible, and this should be prioritized above creating commercial opportunity and content.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Wellness Remodel&nbsp;</i>author — who also shares <a href=#>daughter Taylor, 12, and son Brayden, 7,</a> with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Tarek El Moussa</strong></a> — denied Anstead’s claims in her own court filing.</p><p class=p1>“The allegation that I am ‘exploiting’ our son is truly offensive and simply untrue,” <a href=#>she wrote in her declaration</a>. “After seeing what Ant has written in his Supplemental Declaration it is clear that his motivation is not Hudson’s best interest. The allegation that I am ‘exploiting’ our son is truly offensive and simply untrue.

This has had great impact on me and my household. Because of this, I have made the decision to no longer feature Hudson on Instagram, my tv shows or any social platforms until he is old enough to make this decision for himself.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “I have always been fine not having Hudson appear on public platforms and have made that clear. My only reason for <a href=#>wanting him to appear on my shows</a>, has always been to participate in the fun activities/outings with our family/siblings.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaapqRirq%2B%2F056YnWWTnsGmv4ycpqifkaN6ra3WZpimoZRisKm%2ByKyroqaRYrWircKkZJyto6m8pcWMnaCsqKWpsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
