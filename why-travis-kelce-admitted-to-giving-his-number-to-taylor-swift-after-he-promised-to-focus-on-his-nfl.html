Since their split in 2022, Kelce has openly acknowledged that he is single. In a statement to the New York Post, Kelce mentioned that he is relishing his independence and dedicating himself to his NFL career.</p><p>However, in a twist that left many fans scratching their heads, Kelce made headlines when he admitted to something that seemed to contradict his commitment to his football career. After previously pledging to prioritize his game above all else, Kelce found himself caught in a storm of speculation after revealing that he had shared his number with none other than the <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>industry's pop sensation, <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>.</strong></p><h2 id=travis-kelce-wanted-to-connect-with-taylor-swift-when-he-attended-her-eras-tour>Travis Kelce Wanted To Connect With Taylor Swift When He Attended Her Eras Tour</h2><p>Travis Kelce initially sparked speculation about a potential romantic connection with Taylor Swift during her Eras Tour stop in Kansas City in July 2023.

In a gesture aligned with Swift's fan traditions, he attended the concert bearing friendship bracelets, one of which he had hoped to give to the pop star. However, it seems the Kansas City Chiefs star couldn't breach Swift's pre-show routines.</p><p>"I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butt-hurt I didn't get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her." Kelce revealed on an episode of his New Heights podcast, alongside his brother, Jason Kelce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After explaining the concept of friendship bracelets to his brother, the 33-year-old added, "If you're up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets, and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Travis Kelce’s Ex-Girlfriend Maya Benberry Cryptically Warns Taylor Swift That He’s A “Cheater”</a></span></p><p>But whether the bracelet was a bold move to share his phone number or simply featured his jersey number, Kelce chose to remain enigmatic about it. "Oooo," Jason Kelce playfully teased his brother, before asking, "Your number as in 87 or your phone number?" However, Travis Kelce opted to keep it discreet, responding with, "You know which one."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-kelce-made-the-first-move-when-he-invited-taylor-swift-to-watch-one-of-his-games>Travis Kelce Made The First Move When He Invited Taylor Swift To Watch One Of His Games</h2><p>After generating speculation about his dating status with Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce addressed the situation in his interview on The Pat McAfee Show.

I did this to myself, Jason. I know this," Kelce joked. "I've noticed a few things. Paparazzi at my house. S--t like that," he added. Both brothers praised Swift's appearance at the game, with Jason joking about Travis finally gaining recognition thanks to her presence.</p><p>"Shout out to Taylor for pulling up. That was pretty ballsy. I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her — the friends and family. She looked amazing and everybody was talking about her in great light." Travis Kelce shared.</p><p>He added, "To see the slow motion chest bumps, to see the high-fives with Mom, to see how, you know, Chiefs kingdom was all excited that she was there — that s--- was absolutely hysterical, and it was definitely a game I’ll remember, that's for damn sure."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Was Stuck In The Middle Of A Love Triangle That Sparked Cheating Rumors</a></span></p><p>Travis Kelce acknowledged his role in attracting attention to the situation, particularly with the friendship bracelet gesture and expressing his disappointment about not meeting Swift. He emphasized the importance of respecting both their private lives, given the disparity in media exposure between them.</p><p>"I think what's real is that it is my personal life and I want to respect both of our lives. She's not in the media as much as I am doing this show every single week and having fun during the NFL season on other guys' shows."</p><p>"I'm enjoying life, and I certainly enjoyed this weekend," he said, hinting that he would likely steer clear of discussing romance in the future. Travis Kelce also joked about their Kansas City Chiefs head coach, Andy Reid, possibly playing matchmaker between him and Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqb%2BiwsisZKSdnJiybrPAr5xmpqWir6a%2BjK2mZqyRrrmwvoysrqKepGKup8DEq2Spqp%2BitrSxw2arqGWWpLC2v4yopWamlqF6pK3RnpyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
