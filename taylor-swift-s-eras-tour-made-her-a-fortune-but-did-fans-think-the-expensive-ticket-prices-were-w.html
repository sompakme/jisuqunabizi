After all, the split was announced while the singer was already performing around the United States. And Swift has also been in the news for the wild ticket prices for her Eras tour. Just how much are some of these tickets?</p><p>According to Music In Minnesota, tickets were supposed to be in the range of $49 and $449. But once fans went onto Ticketmaster, they saw prices that were much higher. The website reported that bots began buying the tickets and then putting them on other websites such as StubHub. This accounts for some of the high prices that people are seeing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-2.jpg><p>Buzzfeed reported that out of several Taylor Swift fans who attended concerts, the cheapest ticket price was $150.

She wrote, “I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them, multiple times, if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could.
