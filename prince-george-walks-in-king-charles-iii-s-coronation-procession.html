His participation in Charles’ coronation makes him the youngest future monarch to be formally involved in such a ceremony. (Charles was just 4 years old when his late mother, <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, was crowned in 1953 and did not have an official role in the festivities.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prince-George-Coronation-inline.jpg><p>Along with George, the Prince and Princess of Wales are the parents of <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a>, 7, and <a href=#>Prince Louis</a>, 5. The little ones arrived at Westminster Abbey with their parents on Saturday, with Louis waving to passersby from the backseat of the state car.</p><p>William and Kate’s eldest son is <a href=#>“very protective” of his younger siblings</a>, a source exclusively told Us Weekly in July 2022, adding, “[He] goes out of his way to help his mother with the household chores, especially when it earns him extra time on electronics!”</p><p>Despite his high placement in <a href=#>the line of succession</a>, George is a “well-grounded, down-to-earth little boy” and a “hard worker” with <a href=#>similar interests to any other child</a> his age. “He’s very sociable and can chat for hours about his favorite soccer players, plus he loves rugby, cricket, all forms of sports really,” the insider told Us.</p><p>The future king is “definitely a daddy’s boy,” per the source. “It’s not just their physical resemblance, they’ve got a ton of the same interests and hobbies in common – even helicopters!”</p><p>Raising a royal heir isn’t always easy, but <a href=#>George’s parents have a “modern approach”</a> when it comes to parenting. “[They’re] strict but fair,” a source exclusively told Us in July 2021. “Open communication is key for them. … [But they] set boundaries and have rules in place.”</p><p>William and Kate have <a href=#>tried to move away</a> from the “stiff upper lip” attitude that <a href=#>defines the royal family</a> and teach their kids “to express their emotions and ask questions to enable them to grow up as healthy adults,” the insider added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>George has made more <a href=#>public appearances with his parents</a> at royal engagements and events over the years, from <a href=#>Elizabeth’s funeral in September 2022</a> to the <a href=#>annual Sandringham Christmas service</a> that December. While they aim to give George and his siblings normal childhoods, the young prince is finding his stride.</p><p>“His confidence has <a href=#>grown leaps and bounds</a> over the last couple of years,” a source exclusively told Us in March 2022. “He is assertive, self-assured and knows what he wants, and doesn’t hold back on speaking his mind. His personality is really starting to shine. … It’s clear Prince William and Kate are raising him well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5xp6mq5%2BVYsSiuMqsZKKmXaC2r7OMnJ%2BaqpyawG61yKKqZpufp7yvrdOipqdloKe8pLHSrKCopl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
