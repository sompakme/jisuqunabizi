As Wight explained it, he ate some bad food before a match with Brock Lesnar, his opponent on the tour, and crapped his pants after taking an F5 during the match.</p><p>“In Cape Town, I had some bad food and this is back when I had the leather pants you know, thank God. I hit that mat, [Brock Lesnar] goes ‘Did you shit?’ I said ‘Yeah’ He goes ‘Hahahahaha, you shit.’ Then while I’m laying in the ring after the F5, he keeps stepping on my stomach,” Wight said, “like he’s trying to get more to come out. He had dumped Paul Heyman in the ring too.”</p><p>“That was the finish and then I would usually get up, pull Paul up, throw Paul over my shoulder, and carry Paul out. That was the end of the night for the heels. We were totally humiliated,” Wight stated. “This night I was humiliated. So, Pauly is lying there he goes ‘You gonna carry me to the back?’ I’m like, ‘No’ ‘What do you mean you’re not gonna carry me to the back?’ ‘I shit myself’ ‘What?’ ‘I shit my pants’ ‘I can’t hear you. What?’ ‘I shit myself!’ ‘Oh, okay, are you alright?”</p><p>Wight joked that he went to the back and you could easily find him since he was “the guy out the back of the arena with a hose, hosing off my pants.” and Renee ended the hilarious exchange with&nbsp;“Thank God they were leather.”</p><p>While the podcast exchange was over, Big Show’s story wasn’t finished just yet. Paul Heyman saw a clip of the show and not only <a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed</a> the Cape Town crap incident, but revealed this wasn’t the worst smelling moment he’d experienced around Wight.</p><p>I hereby confirm @PaulWight shit his pants taking the F5 from @BrockLesnar. I am also breaking the (18 year old) news that it wasn’t the worst smelling moment in his life. There was this one time he stunk up the entire State of Alaska with a 3 minute fart.
