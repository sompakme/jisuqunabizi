These stars are not shy about their love of gaming.</p><h2 id=samuel-l-jackson><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Samuel L. Jackson</span></h2><p>Samuel L. Jackson has played many roles where he got to pull the trigger on thugs and toughs. Movies like Pulp Fiction come to mind, where he put the fear of God into his victims by quoting the Bible before filling them with bullets. In real life, he gets plenty of practice with first-person shooters. According to GameRant, <a href=#>and other sources</a>, the man famous for his use of the word "motherf**ker" is into games like Grand Theft Auto, Fallout, and Call of Duty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-fox><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Megan Fox</span></h2><p>Megan Fox defies the stereotype that gamers are all nerdy dudes. The gorgeous actress and socialite is a big fan of the Halo franchise, according to comments she made in an interview with Collider. She's not just a first-person shooter gamer either. Fox is also a fan of fighting games, especially Mortal Kombat. Fox has endured the sexism of some gamers when playing online but seems to enjoy the fact they do not know they are trolling one of the world's most famous actresses. "They make fun of my gamer tag too because it is funny. And they are all a bunch of guys and it is clear that I am a girl so they make fun of my name, and they have no idea they are making fun of me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=henry-cavill><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Henry Cavill</span></h2><p>Cavill is into RPGs, role-playing games, and his favorite is World Of Warcraft. Allegedly, his love of WoW nearly caused him to lose his role as <a href=#>Superman</a>. According to a story in Blastr and How Stuff Works, Cavill almost blew off Zach Snyder when he was offered his role in Man of Steel because he was deep in a very important game of WoW. No word as to whether or not he completed his mission.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Henry Cavill's Girlfriend Went From Spoiled Teen To Business Leader</a></span></p><h2 id=zac-efron><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Zac Efron</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Efron might look like a Hollywood pretty boy, but in his chest beats the heart of a gamer. Efron enjoys first-person shooters, and probably many other games, but we know for a fact he is a die-hard fan of Halo. He was the host of the Halo 3 launch event in Los Angeles in 2007.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Dwayne Johnson</span></h2><p>A game controller must look tiny in the mighty hands of Dwayne Johnson. But amusing as that sight might be, Johnson's love of games is nothing to laugh at, <a href=#>unless he's playing against his co-star Kevin Hart</a>. Johnson <a href=#>is a fan of sports games fighting games like Mortal Kombat</a>. He is also a fan of a classic arcade and N64 game called Rampage. Johnson was lucky enough to star in the film version of Rampage in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brie-larson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brie Larson</span></h2><p>Not all video games are about fighting and shooting, some are about creating a world all your own. Games like Minecraft come to mind, and the same can be said of Animal Crossing. The Captain Marvel star loves her Animal Crossing village. She even did a commercial for the Nintendo Switch and Animal Crossing. According to GameRant, she is mostly into Nintendo and also enjoys classics like The Legend of Zelda and Mario Brothers.</p><h2 id=matthew-perry><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Matthew Perry</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an episode of Friends, Chandler and Monica are given an old-school Ms. Pac-Man game. A running gag in the episode is that Perry's character is terrible at games. In real life, Matthew Perry is a very prominent gamer. He revealed in an interview on Ellen that his gaming habits almost gave him carpal tunnel syndrome. Funny enough, the same thing happened to Chandler when he finally beat Ms. Pac-Man. Perry was also one of the voice actors used for Fallout 3.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of Friends Did Some Weird Roles Before Getting Famous</a></span></p><h2 id=vin-diesel><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Vin Diesel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnson and Diesel might have a bit of an on and off-screen rivalry thanks to the Fast and Furious films they compete with each other in, but they do have one thing in common in real life: video games. Diesel is a fan of Call of Duty and other first-person shooters. Although he looks like a classic jock, Diesel is a bit of a nerd. He is also a big fan of the role-playing board game Dungeons and Dragons.</p><h2 id=mila-kunis><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Mila Kunis</span></h2><p>At its peak, it seemed like everyone with a computer was playing World of Warcraft. One of those addicted gamers was the lovely Mila Kunis. According to GameRant she has since stepped back from the classic role-playing game and now favors "less time-consuming games" like the always popular Call of Duty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-craig><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Daniel Craig</span></h2><p>Perhaps he needed some help practicing his aim for all the shooting he did as James Bond. Or maybe he's just a normal dude who likes to unwind with a game every once in a while. Either way, Daniel Craig loves his Grand Theft Auto. He is also a fan of Halo, not just the game itself, but the use of lore and storytelling that has made the game so influential.</p><h2 id=steven-spielberg><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Steven Spielberg</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It should not surprise anyone that the director of Ready Player One is an avid gamer in real life and has been one for generations. Spielberg has been around since the days of Pong and Atari, a<a href=#>nd today he is quite the avid gamer </a>who enjoys everything game-related, especially Call of Duty and Halo. Fun fact: the video game version of Spielberg's classic E.T. is widely considered to be the worst video game in gaming history. Rumors circulated for years that unsold cartridges of the game were buried somewhere in the middle of the desert. <a href=#>The story was confirmed</a> when hundreds of Atari cartridges were dug up on the outskirts of a small town in New Mexico.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZmiqHq4tM5mo6iulWLDqrDEqGSgmZ2awHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
