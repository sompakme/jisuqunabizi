Bernie Taupin shared that he loved the Ray Bradbury short story "The Rocket Man" which was published as part of a book of short stories called "The Illustrated Man." In the story, being an astronaut is a much more common career than it is now. John said, “‘Rocket Man’ was our first-ever number one record I think – and it was on the Honky Chateau record. It was a pretty easy song to write a melody to because it’s a song about space so it’s quite a spacious song.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elton-john-doesn-39-t-enjoy-performing-quot-crocodile-rock-quot><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Elton John Doesn't Enjoy Performing "Crocodile Rock"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/elton-john-tried-suing-his-accounting-firm-for-30-million-but-instead-lost-12-million-of-his-fortune.jpg><p>When Elton John's song "Crocodile Rock" came out in 1972, it did well immediately. It's a light-hearted tune about dancing and having fun, with lyrics like "Crocodile Rocking is something shocking/When your feet just can't keep still/I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will."</p><p>According to Smooth Radio, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elton John doesn't like performing "Crocodile Rock."</a> He said, "There are certain songs that you think, 'Ugh, I gotta f***in' sing that one again!'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added, "Probably 'Crocodile Rock!' But the audience love it and, y'know, it's a guilty pleasure, as they say." According to Entertainment.ie, he said on the podcast Deeney Talks that he would add it to his set list at concerts because he knew that his fanbase enjoyed it, but he definitely didn't. John said, "The last time I have to sing Crocodile Rock I will probably throw a party. It was written as a kind of a joke, like a pastiche."</p><h2 id=elton-john-could-tell-quot-your-song-quot-would-be-a-hit><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Elton John Could Tell "Your Song" Would Be A Hit</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/elton-john.jpg><p>When people think about Elton John's best songs, the 1970 hit "Your Song" is definitely at the top of the list. It's one of the songs that made him famous. The lyrics of the chorus are as positive and lovely today as they ever were:</p><p>"And you can tell everybody/This is your song/It may be quite simple, but/Now that it's done/I hope you don't mind/I hope you don't mind that I put down in words/How wonderful life is while you're in the world."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/why-elton-john-won-t-be-leaving-his-kids-a-huge-inheritance.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Why Elton John Won’t Be Leaving His Kids A Huge Inheritance">Why Elton John Won’t Be Leaving His Kids A Huge Inheritance</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Despite his insane net worth, Elton John has a different mindset when it comes to leaving his children with an inheritance.</p><p>Sometimes, an artist isn't sure that what they are working on is going to be a success. However, it sounds like Elton John was confident about "Your Song."</p><p>In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, John shared that he loved the words that Bernie Taupin had penned, and he could tell that this song would work out. He said, “I remember writing it at my parents' apartment in North London and Bernie giving me the lyrics. [I sat] down at the piano and looked at it, going, ‘Oh, my God, this is such a great lyric, I can't f*ck this one up’. It came out in about 20 minutes, and when I was done, I called him in and we both knew.”</p><h2 id=elton-john-loved-the-lion-king-song-quot-the-circle-of-life-quot><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Elton John Loved The Lion King Song "The Circle Of Life"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/elton-john-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When a musician is approached to contribute a song to a movie, they might not always be on board right away. Some might worry about how the tune will be received by the public. Others might feel that the songwriting process is too different from what they're used to.</p><p>In the '90s, Tim Rice asked Elton John if he wanted to sing a song for The Lion King, and John was happy to do so. According to Good Morning America, Elton still looks back fondly on the song.</p><p>He said, "It was one of the greatest things to happen in my life in 1993 when Sir Tim Rice rang me up and said, 'Disney don't think you want to do this, will you do "The Lion King?"' and I went, 'Are you kidding me?'"</p><p>John continued "It changed my whole life" and also shared how much he loves the Broadway musical. He said, "Because it's such a magical show, brilliantly put on the stage by Julie Taymor. Everytime you go and see it, you just get goosebumps. It's extraordinary and I'm so proud to be a part of it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elton-john-wanted-to-collaborate-on-quot-hold-me-closer-quot-to-help-britney-spears><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Elton John Wanted To Collaborate On "Hold Me Closer" To Help Britney Spears</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-britney-spears-pay-a-fortune-for-a-treatment-she-didn-t-want-that-made-her-lose-control-of-her-legs_.jpg><p>In 2021, Elton John put the album "The Lockdown Sessions" out into the world. Fans were thrilled to hear "Hold Me Closer," his collaboration with Britney Spears. The tune is a modern take on John's songs "Don't Go Breaking My Heart," "The One," and "Tiny Dancer."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/what-happened-between-lady-gaga-and-elton-john_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What Happened Between Lady Gaga And Elton John?">What Happened Between Lady Gaga And Elton John?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Elton John and Lady Gaga are so close, he named her the godmother of his children.</p><p>While it makes sense that John would want to release a new version of "Tiny Dancer" since that is one of his most well-known songs, it's interesting to hear the reason why he knew he should work with Spears. In September 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John talked about "Tiny Dancer"</a> in an interview with The Globe and Mail.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He shared that his husband David Furnish felt that Spears would feel great if she and John worked together.
