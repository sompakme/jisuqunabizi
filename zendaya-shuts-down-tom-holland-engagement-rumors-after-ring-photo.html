Fans started to wonder whether Holland, 27, proposed to his longtime girlfriend after Zendaya, also 27, posted a selfie via her Instagram Story on Thursday, September 21, in which she was wearing a pretty massive ring.
However, the Euphoria star was quick to shut down the rumors.
“I can’t post anything. You guys, I posted it for my hat, not for the ring on my right finger, you guys,” she said in a since-deleted Instagram video, which has since been reposted by various fan accounts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She paired the look with an <a href=#>old school Golden State Warriors hat</a>.

For years, they denied that they were more than just friends. However, when photographers caught them packing on <a href=#>the PDA in Holland’s car</a> during a July 2021 trip to Los Angeles, their romance could no longer be hidden.</p><p>Later that year, Holland addressed their relationship publicly for the first time. He commented on the kissing photos, noting that the couple “felt robbed of our privacy” in that moment.</p><p>“One of the downsides of our fame is that privacy isn’t really in our control anymore, and a moment that you think is between two people that love each other very much is now a moment that is shared with the entire world,” Holland told <a href=# rel=noopener>GQ</a> in November 2021. “I’ve always been really adamant to keep my private life private, because I share so much of my life with the world anyway.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Zendaya-Shuts-Down-Tom-Holland-Engagement-Rumors-After-Posting-Ring-Photo-2.jpg><p>Since then, however, the pair have been more open about their love. Zendaya and Holland often share <a href=#>subtle moments via social media</a> and have even gotten more comfortable discussing each other in interviews. In fact, Holland offered a sweet update on their relationship in June.</p><p>“I’m locked up, so <a href=#>I’m happy and in love</a>. So, I’ve got no need for rizz,” he joked in a <a href=# rel=noopener>BuzzFeed interview</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later that month, a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly exclusively</a> that Holland is “proud to call Zendaya his girlfriend and express how much he loves her because he wants the world to know.”</p><p>The insider added: “Zendaya and Tom really did their best to keep their romance under wraps when they first started dating. Before they began seeing each other, they had both always been very private when it came to their personal lives. It was something that bonded them in the early stages of their relationship because they were both on the same page when it came to avoiding public speculation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaznZ6ZrrqtjKyfrqyjYrGww81mq6ilXZ28rbjAp5tmnZ6crqixzJ6lrWWiqrqwvtJmmJ%2Bslad6s7XNoGSpoJ%2BpvHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
