“Walking into 2024!” the 51-year-old actress captioned a video via Instagram on Monday, January 1, which showed her wearing a glamorous black sequin dress layered over black trousers. As she strutted through what looks like a tropical paradise complete with palm tree leaves, Tracee wore a fluffy white fur coat draped over her shoulders.
She wore her hair slicked back into a tight bun and opted for a swipe of her signature red lipstick and black eyeliner to top the look off."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During my childhood, she would only wear tracksuits if they were fancy and with high heels.”</p><p>In the same interview, Tracee explained that clothes helped her to cover up her insecurities. “It was a way to present an identity – if I wore a great outfit, I could conquer the world. When I was a toddler, I’d wrap myself in a bedsheet, wear Mum’s heels and become a queen. Now, clothing is a form of creative expression.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6m%2Foq%2FEnmSepJyewG6%2BzqyqZqilqcBurYytqaiomZiurXnSqaCnZZ%2BjeqJ51qKlraqpYsSptdOeZJ%2BtomKwsK3TaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
