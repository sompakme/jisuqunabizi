"There is nothing I can do to stop those who believe in this conspiracy. They are so connected to what they believe that they will not see the truth for what it really is."</p><p><strong>"I'm sure many people look and find all these little conspiracies that happen in life interesting," he said about the fans. "I'd be lying if I said it didn't irritate me a little, but it's the nature of the job."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That doesn't mean there aren't moments when the rumors don't get on his nerves, as he doesn't want the people close to him reading false theories about his personal life.</p><p><strong>"There are times when it gets very personal. I have my son, Freddie. He is the most important person in my life. <a href=#>And occasionally, [these rumors] end up addressing things that are a little unfair</a>."</strong></p><p>Still, he prefers to let it go. "This is what we have now. There's nothing I can do about it. Nothing I can say to stop people from inventing what they want to invent. So, so be it."</p><h2 id=louis-tomlinson-finds-the-rumors-disrespectful>Louis Tomlinson Finds The Rumors Disrespectful</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/louis-tomlinson-premiere-of-all-of-those-voices.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the One Direction alum doesn't normally like to talk about the rumors, this is not the first time he's shared how the speculations make him feel. A few years ago, he called the rumors about him and Harry Styles "disrespectful" to his girlfriend at the time, and said it even affected the way he interacted with his friend.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/harry-styles-louis-tomlinson.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Harry Styles And Louis Tomlinson Met In A Very Weird Way (Before One Direction)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson were closest in One Direction, and that may have been helped by a chance meeting early on.</span><p>"I’ve never actually been asked about it directly. It’s a funny thing. It kind of happened naturally for me and Harry because a certain amount of the fans drew up this conspiracy. <strong>When it first came around I was with Eleanor, and it actually felt a little bit disrespectful to Eleanor, who is my girlfriend now," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Louis Tomlinson said in 2017</a></strong>.</p><p>He also said that it created a bit of tension between him and Harry Styles. "I’m so protective over things like that, about the people I love. <strong>So it created this atmosphere between the two of us where everyone was looking into everything we did. It took away the vibe you get off anyone. It made everything a little bit more unapproachable</strong>. I think [what’s happened since] shows that it was never anything 'real' if I can use that word."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqK2ZqHq1u8yloKern6N6p7XNmqOlsV2WsaW%2BxKyqnqtdp8Kuu9GsZKunnZa7pLGMsKCtoF2drrO%2B2GaqrbGcmsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
