But at the peak of his fame, he was also well-known for being married to Valerie Bertinelli. The two were a beloved power couple in Hollywood.</p><p>At the time, Bertinelli was an up-and-coming actress. It seems that her relationship with Eddie only helped to push her more into the spotlight. So when the pair divorced, Hollywood was shocked and saddened. Fortunately, the two remained close after their separation, raising their son Wolf together.</p><p>And while Eddie remarried and continued rocking, Valerie Bertinelli went her own way and found quite an impressive level of success solo. With a long list of accomplishments and another marriage under her belt, Bertinelli seems happy with her life's path.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/what-was-eddie-van-halen-and-valerie-bertinelli-s-relationship-really-like-before-the-musician-s-tragic-death_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What Was Eddie Van Halen And Valerie Bertinelli’s Relationship Really Like Before The Musician’s Tragic Death?">What Was Eddie Van Halen And Valerie Bertinelli’s Relationship Really Like Before The Musician’s Tragic Death?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Before Eddie Van Halen passed away in 2020, he and his ex-wife Valerie Bertinelli had a unique relationship.</p><p><strong>Updated December 2023: </strong>Over the last year, Valerie Bertinelli has embraced a health and wellness journey in hopes of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspiring her fans to recognize that "they are enough" just how they are</a>. In doing so, Bertinelli is making changes to her lifestyle that include exercising. This has been reflected on her Food Network show, 'Valerie's Home Cooking', swapping out ingredients in some of her dishes to make them healthier. However, now that the show has been canceled from the Food Network lineup, Bertinelli will have to share her insights on Instagram.</p><h2 id=valerie-bertinelli-and-eddie-van-halen-rsquo-s-divorce-was-shocking>Valerie Bertinelli And Eddie Van Halen’s Divorce Was Shocking</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/what-was-eddie-van-halen-and-valerie-bertinelli-s-relationship-really-like-before-the-musician-s-tragic-death_.jpg><p>One celebrity couple that virtually everyone thought would stay together until death did them part was Valerie Bertinelli and Eddie Van Halen.

And by all accounts, <a href=#>Van Halen was a great dad to their son</a>.</strong></p><p>Most observers were shocked when it was announced that Bertinelli and Van Halen separated in 2001.</p><p>Even after that event, the couple seemed reluctant to actually end their marriage, as <strong>it wasn’t until 2007 that their divorce was finalized.</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Matthew-Perry-with-Valerie-Bertinelli.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What Happened Between Matthew Perry And Valerie Bertinelli?">What Happened Between Matthew Perry And Valerie Bertinelli?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Matthew Perry and Valerie Bertinelli had a connection before he starred on Friends, but what really happened?</p><h3 id=valerie-bertinelli-and-eddie-van-halen-divorced-but-remained-close>Valerie Bertinelli And Eddie Van Halen Divorced, But Remained Close</h3><p>Sadly, a lot of couples share nothing but hatred following their divorces.

For that reason, it makes sense that Bertinelli has made it clear during interviews and on social media that she has struggled with Van Halen’s passing. It has also been noted that Bertinelli was in the room alongside her son and Eddie’s widow when the late guitarist passed away.</p><h2 id=valerie-bertinelli-rsquo-s-success-continued-post-divorce>Valerie Bertinelli’s Success Continued Post-Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar48886315-1.jpg><p>When an actor becomes associated with a hit show, it oftentimes can be extremely difficult for them to find more success in the entertainment business once that series ends.</p><p>For a long time, it seemed like Valerie Bertinelli was going to be another example of an actor who never reached the zenith again after their career-making show came to an end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully for her legions of fans, however, Bertinelli’s career took off again the same year she separated from Eddie Van Halen.</p><p>Even though Valerie Bertinelli and Eddie Van Halen finalized their divorce in 2007, it is interesting to note that <strong>she had a career resurgence the same year they initially split.</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/did-valerie-bertinelli-s-love-for-eddie-van-halen-ruin-her-marriage-to-tom-vitale.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did Valerie Bertinelli’s Love For Eddie Van Halen Ruin Her Marriage To Tom Vitale?">Did Valerie Bertinelli’s Love For Eddie Van Halen Ruin Her Marriage To Tom Vitale?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Valerie Bertinelli’s marriage to Tom Vitale might've ended because of Eddie Van Halen.</p><h3 id=valerie-bertinelli-movies-and-tv-shows>Valerie Bertinelli Movies And TV Shows</h3><p>After all, Bertinelli starred in the television drama Touched by an Angel from 2001 until 2003.

Unfortunately, the Food Network decided to cancel Valerie's Home Cooking in 2023. The final episode aired in July. The reason for the cancelation is unknown.</p><p>Largely due to all the shows that she has headlined following her divorce, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertinelli currently has a $20 million fortune</a>.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Valerie also found love again after Van Halen. She married Tom Vitale in 2011, six years after they began dating, but did not have more children. Tom and Valerie filed for divorce in 2021.</p><p>By all appearances, however, Valerie seems satisfied with her life and career and is proud of her son, Wolfie and his musical prowess, which he no doubt inherited from his famous dad.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicnZyZmnq3rc1mn5qklaN6uLXFnmSesF2rrq2x0aKcZpqVp8GqusSlo6JlnprBbsPOq6uhZZSew7C%2Bwp5knJmimrKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
