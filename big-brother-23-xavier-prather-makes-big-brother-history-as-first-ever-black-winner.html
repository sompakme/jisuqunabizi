Well, after 3 HoH wins, 4 Veto wins, and 5 eviction nominations, Xavier proved himself to be the best of the best.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Big Brother 23': Kyland's Shocking Eviction Outraged Fans</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Xavier and Kyland ran the house</a> prior to Young's eviction, making it apparent that X would be the clear winner here. Although Tiffany was a fan favorite, there's no question that Xavier's Big Brother win, was one well deserved.</p><h2 id=xavier-prather-makes-39-big-brother-39-history>Xavier Prather Makes 'Big Brother' History</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In all 23 seasons of Big Brother, never before has there been a Black winner, that is until now, of course! At the very start of the season, Tiffany and Xavier put their masterminded plan to work as they created The Cookout. The goal? For Hannah, Kyland, Derek F, Azah, Tiff, and X to make it to the end, securing a win of the six of them.</p><p>Well, not only did they make history as one of the best alliances in the game, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Xavier took home the win</a> with a unanimous 9-0 vote, making him the first Black player to win the game. Although Tamar Braxton won Big Brother Celebrity, which fans have pointed out this season, the standard version of the show has yet to crown a Black player until this very moment!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Tiffany was clearly in the running for that $750,000, Xavier is undoubtedly deserving of his win. The model/attorney/basketball expert, mhm, you know that's right, not only played a stellar social game but one of the best physical games, as well.</p><p>With a series of Head of Household, and Veto wins under his belt, Xavier slayed each and every challenge, making it clear he deserved tonight's win, for sure! Not only did he deserve the win, but Xavier has proven that Big Brother can totally be won with some dignity, class, and grace.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think 'Big Brother' Rigged This Competition</a></span></p><h2 id=39-bb23-39-secrets-revealed>'BB23' Secrets Revealed</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to revealing who won Big Brother 23, Julie Chen allowed a few houseguests to reveal some details that they've been keeping to themselves. Big D, who is notoriously known for being the youngest son of boxing icon, Joe Frazier, shocked his fellow housemates when he let the cat out of the bag. The group also had a similar reaction to Xavier revealing his basketball background and the fact that he is a licensed attorney.</p><p>One of the most touching reveals came from Britini, who shared with her castmates and viewers that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she is autistic</a>. The BB player wanted to keep this to herself, as to not fall into a label, and have the players love her for her and not her diagnosis. As if that weren't enough, Britini also let her pals in on the fact that she is a martial arts master, with a 4th-degree black belt.</p><h2 id=tiffany-wins-america-39-s-favorite-player>Tiffany Wins America's Favorite Player!</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we all knew it was coming, the mastermind behind The Cookout, Tiffany Mitchell won tonight's America's Favorite Player prize. Julie Chen revealed that it was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">close call between her and Derek X</a>, however, Tiff was the one who walked away with a whopping $50,000!</p><p>Considering the work she put into this season, carrying The Cookout at times, all while proving to be a master strategizer, it's no surprise that she took home AFP. As we bid farewell to this season, Big Brother will be back in February with yet another BB Celebrity edition, and we cannot wait!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'Big Brother 23': Has Derek Frazier Floated Through The Competition?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZop9dl7%2BwwMeeqWZqY2LEqbuMsKanZZKetG6u0airoZ2iYsWiwsieqWaoopbBqbHRZp2iqqOpeqO4wJyiZq%2BZo7umvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
