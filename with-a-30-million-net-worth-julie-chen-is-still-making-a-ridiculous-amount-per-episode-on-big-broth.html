In truth, things did not start off great for the show. 'BB' was instantly compared to Survivor, which caused some tough expectations.</p><p>Julie Chen herself admitted that at the time, <a href=#>the future looked quite rocky for the program</a>. "Everyone hated Big Brother season 1. The critics hated it. They hated the show. It wasn't Survivor. They hated me -- I wasn't [Survivor's] Jeff Probst. I wrote it off. I was like, ‘Yeah, I'm not too crazy about it either."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Appearing On 'Celebrity Big Brother' Went Wrong For Todrick Hall</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only was the show not well-received but <a href=#>Julie Chen was basically forced into taking the gig</a>. "I was working at the network morning news reader for The Early Show for only nine months when I was approached about hosting Big Brother. I asked if taking this job would forever seal the door shut for me to become a 60 Minutes correspondent and when I was told probably."</p><p>"I said then that makes my decision easy and I turned down the job. Then I was told if I didn't take it, it could technically be assigned to me and if I didn't do it, it could be considered insubordination."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did Chen take the gig, but she was roasted at the start, with fans claiming that her presentation was way too robotic and scripted. Well, she's doing something right as 24 seasons later, the host is still at the forefront of the reality show, making millions per season.</p><h2 id=julie-chen-is-making-millions-per-season-on-big-brother>Julie Chen Is Making Millions Per Season On Big Brother</h2><p>Julie Chen has been on TV for a very long time, thus, her $30 million net worth does make a lot of sense. Chen is more than just Big Brother, finding spots on the shows like The Talk.</p><p>When it comes to her Big Brother life, the host has made a fortune. <a href=#>Page Six speculated on her current salary</a> and the belief is that the host is making a huge salary worth $3 million per season.

What it means if you’ve won that little competition and what it means for your gameplay, where you stand in the game, will be revealed. It’ll be a 90-minute process,” Chen-Moonves told GlobalTV.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Julie would also state that eviction night will look quite different, offering the contestants a new twist.
