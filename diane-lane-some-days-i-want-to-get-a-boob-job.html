In fact, the actress tells the October issue of <a href=#>Ladies' Home Journal</a> that she's considered getting plastic surgery to change her appearance.</p><p>"Some days I want to get a boob job, some days I want to get the eye lift. Then other days I'm like, 'Absolutely not! Have some integrity! Be those footprints in the sand that lead other forward in a more dignified manner,'" Lane says. "But it's all about what makes you happy. It's a hyper-personal domain."</p><p>Still, the 45-year-old actress says her husband of six years years <strong>Josh Brolin</strong> helps her to remember what matters most in life.</p><p>"I recently said to Josh, 'Being in a relationship makes it impossible to avoid yourself.' It may not always make me comfortable but it sure has made me a better person," she tells the mag. "And I'll take that any day."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But just because Lane has a supportive husband, that doesn't mean the star of this fall's Secretariat has a perfect marriage.</p><p>"At my own peril I will quote Mae West, who said, 'Getting married is like trading in the adoration of many for the sarcasm of one.' I embrace that. Bring it on. Because that's what intimacy is: It's a willingness to be vulnerable, a willingness to bite my tongue and a willingness to set an example of what I believe in," she says. "And it's hard! Look at all of the sages throughout history. They lived alone."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGadoZGjsm64yJqlnmWjpLqmecOasKxlmWLEorrTZquoZZeawW6tjJumqJpdn7yjeZFpaGlpYG58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
