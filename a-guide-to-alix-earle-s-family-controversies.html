I was told that I had to be respectful to this woman and we had to be nice to her and I wanted to rip her head off.,” Alix said. “It was very weird because I felt like I was a 10-year-old having to be more mature than someone [who was] 20, 30 years older than me.”</p><p>She’s in a <a href=#>better place with her stepmom</a> now. “[We’re] super close, and we’ve gotten to such a good point. Whatever’s happened in the past, we’ve all gotten past it as a family,” Alix told<a href=#> Elle </a>in August 2023.</p><p>She added, “One time, I was overwhelmed about something of mine and I called my dad. He was like, ‘You should really talk to Ashley about this. She has dealt with this before, stuff in the media.’ It’s brought us closer because she’s able to guide me through it.”</p><p>Ashley first gained notability in 2008 during <a href=#><strong>Eliot Spitzer</strong></a>’s prostitution scandal, which led to him resign as the governor of New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Alix-Earles-Blended-Family-of-8-6.jpg><h3>Ashtin Earle, Alix’s Sister</h3><p><strong>Ashtin</strong> is the daughter of Alisa and TJ.
