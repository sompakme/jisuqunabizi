The car driver who hit the young boy was 20 years old; he pulled over the boy and helped the authorities. The accident is still being looked into.</p><p></p><p>He might be charged under the <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lisa Torry Smith Act</a></span>, also called the Crosswalk Law.

The 20 mph limit is in effect as a result.</p><p>Authorities observed the same tragedy in <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fort Bend County</a></span> twice in the past two weeks. However, no further details regarding the boy and the male driver have not been disclosed publicly.</p><p>Thoughts and Condolences to the victim’s family in this tough time; his sudden demise surely left his family in shock and disbelief.
