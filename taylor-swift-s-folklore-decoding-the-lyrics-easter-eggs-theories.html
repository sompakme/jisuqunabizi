The 30-year-old Grammy winner surprised fans on July 23 when sheannounced plans to drop a new album at midnight.
“Folklore; an entire brand new album of songs I’ve poured all of my whims, dreams, fears and musings into,” she wrote via Instagram. “Most of the things I had planned this summer didn’t end up happening, but there is something I hadn’t planned on that DID happen."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity,” the singer explained. “Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss 20 years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. … Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I’ve never met, people I’ve known, or those I wish I hadn’t.”</p><p>Swift noted that the “lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and fiction become almost indiscernible” in folklores.</p><p>“In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result,” she wrote. “Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history and memory. I’d told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder and whimsey they deserve.”</p><p>Swift concluded that the stories were up to her fans to pass on — <a href=#>and they have happily accepted the job.</a> She also gave them more insight into her writing process during a live chat on YouTube as the<a href=#> “Cardigan” video</a> premiered on July 24.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“One thing I did purposely on this album was put the Easter eggs in the lyrics, more than just the videos,” Swift wrote. “I created character arcs & recurring themes that map out who is singing about who.”</p><p>Scroll through for a breakdown of the lyrics and theories for every song from <a href=#>Folklore</a>:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bprrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8G0ecWoo6Skn6eybrDEnKadoZ6cerW0xGajsqqZmMBuscCsq56qXZq0qL%2BMrZ%2Bep6KesrR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
