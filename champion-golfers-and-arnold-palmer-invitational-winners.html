 The historic tournament is part of The Open Qualifying Series for the first time and three places are up for grabs this week.
The tournament was first established in 1966 as the Florida Citrus Open Invitational and has had several names before re-branding in 2007 in honour of the two-time Champion Golfer of the Year."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A four-time major winner, he has won almost everything the game has to offer him – including The 143rd Open.<br></span></p><p><span class=article-copy>There, at Royal Liverpool, he held his nerve to win by two strokes from Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia after firing rounds of 66, 66, 68 and 71.&nbsp;<br></span></p><p><span class=article-copy>Victory this week could set him off for another run at the Claret Jug on home turf.</span></p><p><span class=article-copy><img height=862 alt=Rory width=1471 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.theopen.com/latest/2019/03/-/media/d98e23b71d5045bba37acae04ac12966.ashx style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span class=article-summary>Tiger Woods<br></span></p><p><span class=article-copy>Of course if McIlroy is going to be successful this summer then he must go through the biggest star in the game.</span></p><p><span class=article-copy>The proclamation that Tiger Woods is back is old news after he secured victory at the Tour Championship last season – now the great American is chasing majors.<br></span></p><p><span class=article-copy>Woods is a three-time Champion Golfer of the Year and if the field needed another reason to fear him – other than the fact he is a 14-time major winner, the sport’s biggest attraction and is named after a man-eating predator – it’s that the last time The Open went to an unfamiliar venue, he won with ease.<br></span></p><p><span class=article-copy>That was at Royal Liverpool, restored to The Open rota for the first time in 39 years when Woods won the last of his Claret Jugs in 2006.<br></span></p><p><span class=article-copy>It is likely that he will be the most successful links player in the field when he tees it up in July, but even his record there is plunged into darkness by his success at Bay Hill.<br></span></p><p><span class=article-copy>Woods has remarkably won the title eight times, including 2003 – when he romped home by 11 strokes.<br></span></p><p><span class=article-copy>That was one of four successes in a row between 2000-2003 and, not content there, he came back for more and swept all before him in 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2013.<br></span></p><p><span class=article-copy>This week’s field must be delighted he is not there this week.
