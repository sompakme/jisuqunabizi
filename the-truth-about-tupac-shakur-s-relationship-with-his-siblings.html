In a few rare cases, however, musical performers have meant so much to the masses they have remained celebrated for years on end. For example, <a href=#>Tupac Shakur’s legacy</a> will go down in history since he recorded a long list of beloved songs even though he passed away when he was far too young</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Surprising Photos Of Tupac Before His Death</a></span></p><p>While there is no doubt that Tupac Shakur is a legend, it also is worth noting that he was a human being just like everyone else. As a result, there is a relatively small group of people who loved Tupac because they knew him personally. On the other hand, <a href=#>Tupac infamously feuded with some of his peers</a> which makes it clear that the legendary rapper didn’t get along with everyone. With all of that in mind, it begs a question, what is the truth of Tupac’s relationship with his siblings?</p><h2 id=tupac-shakur-rsquo-s-relationship-with-his-half-sister-sekyiwa-ldquo-set-rdquo-shakur>Tupac Shakur’s Relationship With His Half-Sister Sekyiwa “Set” Shakur</h2><p>Over the years, there has been a lot of conversation about Tupac Shakur’s relationship with his famous activist mother Afeni Shakur. Given that both mother and son led incredible lives which resulted in many people celebrating them and others to decrying them, that makes a lot of sense. However, one thing that a lot of people don’t realize is that Afeni had more than one child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Ways Tupac Changed The World</a></span></p><p>Two years after Tupac Shakur was born, his mother Afeni Shakur gave birth to her second child, a daughter that was named Sekyiwa Shakur. While Sekyiwa had a different biological father than her famous brother, that never seemed to come between the half-siblings. In fact, Tupac loved his sister so much that he name-checked her nickname Set in some of his songs.</p><p>When Tupac Shakur’s life was taken from him when he was only twenty-five years old, his fans all over the world mourned. Of course, it should go without saying that his half-sister was devastated on a much more personal level. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tupac and Set grew up and made it through their difficult childhood together</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Tupac Shakur and Sekyiwa “Set” Shakur had a close bond, she reportedly spent a long time not wanting people to know who her famous brother is. The reason for that is Set needed to find her own space in the world instead of people defining her by her famous brother and mother’s reputations. Thankfully, Set has seemingly become a lot more confident in recent years and she now is happy to celebrate her brother’s legacy publically. Clearly, Pac and Set loved each other dearly.</p><h2 id=tupac-shakur-rsquo-s-relationship-with-his-stepbrother-mopreme-shakur>Tupac Shakur’s Relationship With His Stepbrother Mopreme Shakur</h2><p>Before Tupac Shakur passed away, he revealed that his biological father wanted nothing to do with him until he became rich and famous. However, that isn’t to say that Tupac went entirely without a male role model during his childhood as he had two different stepfathers when he was a kid. Thanks to one of his mother’s marriages, Tupac also had an older stepbrother Mopreme Harding who would later go by the last name Shakur.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Tupac Is Alive': Filmmaker Claims He Knows Where He's Hiding</a></span></p><p>Even though Tupac Shakur and Mopreme Shakur’s parents wound up getting divorced, they still considered themselves to be brothers. As a result, Tupac and Mopreme remained close up until the moment that the legendary rapper was killed. Still very protective of Tupac’s legacy, when <a href=#>Donald Trump’s</a> camp put out a statement about leaving a ticket for Tupac to attend one of the President’s rallies, Mopreme called the publicity stunt out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of being Tupac Shakur’s brother, Mopreme Shakur also was his peer. After all, Mopreme is a rapper who has gone under his real name and also been known as Wycked and Konami. While it is obvious that he never reached the heights his brother did, Mopreme was a member of two hip hop groups with Tupac, Thug Life and Outlawz.</p><h2 id=tupac-shakur-rsquo-s-relationship-with-his-godbrother-yaki-kadafi>Tupac Shakur’s Relationship With His Godbrother Yaki Kadafi</h2><p>When Tupac Shakur’s mother Afeni was still pregnant with the future rap superstar, she stood trial alongside several other members of the Black Panthers including Sekou Odinga. During that time period, Afeni and Odinga’s wife Yaasmyn Fula became extremely close and the pair went on to work together as paralegals and even lived together. When the two women lived together, Yaasmyn refused to testify against some of her fellow activists and she was sent to prison for eighteen months as a result.</p><p>When Yaasmyn Fula lived with Afeni Shakur, she had a son who would later go by Yaki Kadafi. When Yaasmyn went to prison, Yaki continued to live with the Shakur family. Since Yaki and Tupac lived together for a long time, they considered each other to be godbrothers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout Tupac’s far too short life, he remained extremely close with Yaki Kadafi. In fact, when Tupac went to prison for eight months, Yaki reportedly visited him daily. On top of that, Yaki and Tupac formed the rap group Outlawz together which also featured Mopreme Shakur. Sadly, Yaki was riding in the vehicle behind the BMW that Tupac was in when the rap legend was shot and suffered the injuries that took his life. From all accounts, Yaki took Tupac’s death extremely hard, to say the least. Not even two months after Tupac’s death, Yaki suffered a similr fate when he was shot and lost his life at only nineteen years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Tupac: 15 Now Forgotten Facts</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirrqiRmHq0tMCkrKurXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW7DyK2fZqCZqHq0tcGloKefo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
