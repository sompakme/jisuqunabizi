After the “Chocolate” singer was <a href=#>spotted</a> at several of <a href=#>Swift’s shows on The Eras Tour</a>, a source told Us Weekly that the twosome had <a href=#>reconnected after a “brief” fling “years ago.”</a></p><p>“They’re looking to give things a second chance,” the source said, adding <a href=#>that the musicians</a> “run in the same circle of friends” and are “having a good time reconnecting again.”</p><p>The insider told Us that the “Tis the Damn Season” singer “really likes” the English rocker and is “happy spending time with him.”</p><p>A second source reiterated that the duo “have been hanging out and are having fun together” and pointed out that the twosome “have a lot of mutual friends, including <a href=#><strong>Jack Antonoff</strong></a>.”</p><p>“They both respect and admire each other’s talent,” the second insider noted.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in April that Swift and Alwyn, 32, had <a href=#>quietly ended their six-year romance</a>.</p><p>“Fame factored into their split. Joe is very shy and never liked all of the attention that came with dating one of the most popular singers in the world,” a third source told Us last month, noting that Swift isn’t at “fault” for the split as the actor never “blamed” her for her success. “He just didn’t like having to be on all of the time.”</p><p>A fourth insider noted that <a href=#>Swift was “handling the breakup”</a> from the Conversations With Friends star “really well and she’s feeling very optimistic about her future.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The source concluded: “She truly believes whatever is meant to be, will be, and knows everything happens for a reason.”</p><p>Scroll through to see pics of Swift and Healy on Monday:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1ecCnm2alkanBunnHnpilsV2hsqLCxGaqra2UnrxuwM6gnK2glad6qrqMp7CcZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
