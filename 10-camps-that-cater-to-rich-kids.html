But while most remember ghost stories told around campfires and endless hours of leather craft and ceramics, rich kids go to specialty camps that cater to their tastes – or at least, the tastes of their parents. Prices range from just under $2000 to over $25,000, for anywhere from 1 to 10 weeks and the camps are located all over the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fiji-shark-studies-camp-6-000-plus-airfare-for-24-days>Fiji Shark Studies Camp/&nbsp;&nbsp;$6,000 plus airfare for&nbsp;24-days</h2><p>via:newswatch.nationalgeographic.com</p><p>Open to high school kids who have their scuba certification, campers get to with swim bull, lemon and tiger sharks at Fiji's Shark Reef Marine Reserve.

This year's 12-day trip was to Paris, France as well as to the enchanting ancient village of Poudenas, deep in Gascony along the&nbsp;Gélise River. Food inspired teens are encouraged to engulf themselves in the history and culture during their stay and must write an essay and get two professional referrals, one from a culinary professional, to compete for a camper spot. Program tuition for 12days is $4750.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=camp-laurel-6-500-plus-expenses-for-4-weeks>Camp Laurel/&nbsp;$6,500 plus expenses for 4 weeks</h2><p>via:www.coolworks.com</p><p>For active kids between 7 and 15 years old, Camp Laurel in Readfield, Maine is paradise. They have two baseball fields, two soccer fields, a lacrosse field, a hockey field, five basketball courts, a roller hockey arena, a beach volleyball court, a 3,000-square foot indoor gymnastics center, an 8,000-square foot indoor fieldhouse with an additional 10 basketball hoops, and 15 all-weather tennis courts as well as every kind of watersport imaginable at Echo Lake. For the extended stay, 50 day camp, it'll cost you $11,400 plus other expenses for laundry, etc. If you're pinching pennies this year, opt for Camp Laurel South where 4 weeks of camp is only $6,500 plus expenses.</p><p></p><h2 id=camp-takajo-11-000-for-50-days>Camp Takajo/ $11,000 for 50 days</h2><p>via:www.camptakajo.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Camp Takajo, also located in Maine, is an all-boys camp dedicated to instilling moral and ethical values into young men through sports, games and special events. The camp prides itself in focusing on integrity, self-respect, respect for others and an appreciation of nature. Making junior the boy you always dreamed he would be doesn't come cheap. For 50 days of summer camp, you have to fork over about $11,000…plus you have to take him and pick him up in Maine.</p><p></p><h2 id=stagedoor-manor-5-645-for-a-3-weeks>Stagedoor Manor/&nbsp;&nbsp;$5,645 for a 3-weeks</h2><p>Via: en.wikipedia.org</p><p>If your 10 to 18 year old child is destined for a career in film or on stage, there couldn't be a better camp choice than Stagedoor Manor. Located near the picturesque Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, Stagedoor Manor has an impressive list of former campers including <a title="Zach Braff Net Worth" href=#>Zach Braff</a>, <a title="Natalie Portman Net Worth" href=#>Natalie Portman</a>, <a title="Robert Downey Jr. Net Worth" href=#>Robert Downey Jr.</a> and <a title="Lea Michele Net Worth" href=#>Lea Michele</a>. They can concentrate on anything from acting, dancing and singing to production, set decoration, lighting – anything to do with film and stage, including guidance from agents, managers and talent agents. The cost isn't as much as many others but it's also not in the Girl Scout camp price range either: $5,645 for a 3-week session.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=princess-prep-3-995-plus-airfare-for-7-days>Princess Prep/&nbsp;$3,995 plus airfare for 7 days</h2><p>Via: princess-prep.com</p><p>For many little girls, the princess fantasy is strong and unyielding. Limited to 7 to 9 year old girls, Princess Prep stresses drawing upon the positive qualities and etiquette of princesshood and applying them to whatever path they choose in real life. The campers stay in the Kensington & Chelsea borough, one of the ritziest districts in the UK, and tour many royal hotspots like the State Apartments that house <a title="Princess Diana Net Worth" href=#>Princess Diana's</a> dress collection, as well as ride horses in Hyde Park, tour the Tower of London, marvel at the glory of the Crown Jewels and Buckingham Palace, and see a production at the theater in London's West End. The cost is quite extravagant as well: $3995 plus airfare for 7days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Yrq680maroZmkYrCiwMSrZK2nXae2pLSMpKCdq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
