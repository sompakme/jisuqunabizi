With the weather cooling off, we know dry skin days are ahead. It’s important that we add some extra moisture to our routine. An overnight moisturizing mask is a nice place to start, but you’ll want to make sure you have something for daytime too so your makeup doesn’t shrivel up as soon as you put it on!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After finishing up all of her makeup, she made sure to include one last essential step. “I always, no matter what, finish with some sort of spray, like a setting spray,” she explained. “It doesn’t have to actually be labeled a setting spray. I love Osea. I love this line so much. And this is their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sea Minerals Mist</a>. It smells good. You feel refreshed. So I always add a spritz as my very last thing.”</p><p>She then proceeded to mist the product over her face, using her hand to fan it dry before raving about Osea a little more. “Their line, everything by them is so good and natural, and I love it. It’s a family-owned business.”</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">OSEA Sea Minerals Mist</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$38</a> at Amazon!
