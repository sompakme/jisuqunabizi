They let us join school plays, or they encourage us to participate in Little League, or they even buy us musical instruments like guitars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We usually start by learning how to strum an acoustic guitar. It may be a classical guitar with nylon strings, or an archtop, or even one with steel strings. Or to have that real rockstar feeling, we eventually learn how to play solid-bodied electric guitars, in which tones can be manipulated electronically with the use of an amplifier.</p><p>The influence of this instrument has been massive. It is the instrument of choice in different genres of music, from rock and bluegrass to country and punk.&nbsp; Some guitars have become as legendary as the guitarist themselves.</p><p>Here are the top ten most expensive guitars in the world.</p><h2 id=1-fender-strat-auctioned-off-for-tsunami-victims---2-7-million><strong>1.

Relief efforts were conducted, and noted musicians were at the forefront. To help raise money, a Fender Strat was auctioned off, with the money going to the victims of the tsunami. It may not have the history of the legendary guitars used by famous guitarists, but it did have the signature of some of the best string players in the world. Among the artists who autographed the guitar were Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Brian May, Jimmy Page, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, Pete Townsend, Mark Knopfler, Ray Davis, Liam Gallagher, Ronnie Wood, Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Tony Iommi, Sting, Ritchie Blackmore, Bryan Adams and members of the Def Leppard.</p><h2 id=2-1968-strat-jimi-hendrix---2-million><strong>2. 1968 Strat, Jimi Hendrix - $2 million</strong></h2><p>Considered the greatest man to ever play the guitar and one of the most important musicians in history, James Marshall Hendrix, or Jimi Hendrix, was an American musician and songwriter. Hendrix initially gained fame in Europe where he played with his band called The Jimi Hendrix Experience. He then went back to the United States where he finally garnered recognition after performing at the Monterey Pop Festival. He also served as one of the headliners in the iconic Woodstock Festival in 1969. He passed away in 1970 due to drug use. During his four years in the limelight, he was able to achieve a lot more than most musicians can ever dream of in their lifetimes. The Strat that Hendrix used in Woodstock was sold for a couple of million of dollars to Paul Allen of Microsoft.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-washburn-bob-marley---1-2-million><strong>3.
