However, when reports emerged that the twosome had rekindled their romance about a year later, there was yet again a glimmer of hope that the duo would finally seal the deal.

The sparks reportedly started flying after McDaid and Sheeran, who happen to be the best of pals, arrived hand-in-hand to one of Cox’s star-studded house parties. "I remember seeing Johnny and going, 'Oh, wow. He's really intense.' He's got the eyes, and he's playing the piano," Cox admitted during her 2022 appearance on Howard Stern’s SiriusXM show. "And I thought 'Oh he's really really handsome.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Friends Had To Ban A Scene Featuring Courteney Cox And Matthew Perry, But Fans Think It Was Better Than What Aired Instead</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cox’s admiration for McDaid became even more pronounced after she started dating him. As testament to her devotion, the Friends alum took every opportunity to let the world know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just how amazing her beau truly is</a>. "[He's] a great listener. And I've never met someone more patient," she told People of McDaid in January 2022. "He's a great advice-giver. I love his heart, his intentions. His morals. He's extremely talented and obviously musical, but he's a poet and a writer. He's just so smart, and I find that really sexy. And then he is gorgeous."</p><p>Fortunately, the Snow Patrol musician was equally spellbound. "My thoughts are never without Court," he said of the Friends star in a 2018 interview with People. "She's my best friend. She's my partner, in everything. When I write her poems, it's just an extension of how I feel every second anyway."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johnny-mcdaid-and-courteney-cox-were-engaged-at-one-point>Johnny McDaid And Courteney Cox Were Engaged At One Point</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/johnny-and-courteney.jpg><p>Following a year of romantic bliss, Johnny McDaid and Courteney Cox found themselves at the pinnacle of a lifetime commitment. Unfortunately, the tides turned on their relationship about a year later, casting a shadow on their future together. Cox would later comment on what the circumstances of the split during a 2016 episode of Running Wild with Bear Grylls.</p><p>“We were engaged for over a year, and then we broke up,” she said. “He's from Ireland. And the way he regards love is precious. We have to treat it in a different way. It's more special — you coddle it. So I didn't know how to regard love the way he does. And I definitely made a lot of mistakes that I see — whether it's codependency or people-pleasing. I didn't know how to bring it in.

Unfortunately, as the years trod on, it became evident that the twosome was not particularly interested in walking down the aisle. "He's not my fiancé,” Cox said of her relationship with McDaid during her 2019 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. “We were engaged to be married, but now we're just together. We broke off our engagement, and he moved to England, then we got back together, and it's actually better than it was before."</p><p>The acclaimed actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seemed even more nonchalant about tying the knot</a> in her 2022 interview with People, responding, "I don't know. I'm definitely not opposed to it. I just don't think about it," when asked if she plans to tie the knot any time soon. Similarly, McDaid is not keen on rushing down the aisle, despite being completely smitten with Courteney. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I just want to be with this woman for the rest of my life</a>,” he told People in 2015. “That is all that matters. The ceremonies are academic."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though they've yet to walk down the aisle, Johnny and Courteney’s devotion to each other remains unwavering. “I don’t know if you can put a label on what makes us work,” McDaid said of his relationship with Courteney in a 2018 interview with People, “but I know that I’ve never loved like I love this woman, so if that’s enough, then that’s enough.”</p><p>Despite defying convention by relegating matrimony, Courteney is still intent on building a family with McDaid. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I would love to have a baby now</a>," she told NewBeauty magazine in 2017. "I know it's crazy, but I would. … I could carry someone else's egg. I may be one of the older people doing it, but I would love to, with Johnny that is."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqK2iqbKvsdhmmqiwXZe8urLRopynnF2fvKm6zbJkppuUlralecyaqauhkZyybr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2anpZmeqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
