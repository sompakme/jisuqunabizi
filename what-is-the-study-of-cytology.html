Cytological tests are <b>used to observe human cells to determine the risk of abnormalities and cancer</b>. The Pap smear test looks at cells as opposed to pieces of tissue and is used to screen women for cervical cancer.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-cytology-the-study-of-life></span>Is cytology The study of life?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>cytology, <b>the study of cells as fundamental units of living things</b>. … In 1892 the German embryologist and anatomist Oscar Hertwig suggested that organismic processes are reflections of cellular processes; he thus established cytology as a separate branch of biology.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-focus-of-cytology></span>What is the focus of cytology?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Cytology is the <b>field that uses the smallest possible tissue sample for diagnosis</b>, reducing criteria as much as possible to the cellular level.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-difference-between-biopsy-and-cytology></span>What is the difference between biopsy and cytology?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In contrast to the acquisition of biopsy samples, material obtained for cytology examination generally <b>requires less morbidity, time and planning</b>. Only a small number of studies have demonstrated the relative value of cytologic, compared to histologic (biopsy), diagnoses in the same patient.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-cell-study></span>What is cell study?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The study of cells or cell biology is called <b>cytology</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-it-is-called-cytology></span>Why it is called cytology?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The discipline was founded by George Nicolas Papanicolaou in 1928. Cytopathology is generally used on samples of free cells or tissue fragments, in contrast to histopathology, which studies whole tissues. Cytopathology is frequently, less precisely, called “cytology”, which means <b>“the study of cells”</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-do-cytopathologists-do></span>What do Cytopathologists do?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Cytopathologists <b>examine cells that have been exfoliated (shed)</b>, scraped from the body or aspirated with a fine needle. Cell specimens are processed into slides and examined microscopically for the diagnosis of cancer, precancerous conditions, benign tumors and some infectious conditions.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-is-a-cytology-test-done></span>How is a cytology test done?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A urine cytology test requires a urine sample, <b>which you provide by urinating into a sterile container</b>. In some cases, a urine sample is collected using a thin, hollow tube (catheter) that’s inserted into your urethra and moved up to your bladder.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-cytology-and-pathology-the-same></span>Is cytology and pathology the same?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Is cytology part of pathology? Cytology (cytopathology) is a branch, <b>or subspecialty, of pathology</b>. In medicine, pathology deals with the laboratory examination of cells in samples of body tissue or fluids for diagnostic purposes.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-discovered-cell></span>Who discovered cell?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Robert Hooke Initially discovered by <b>Robert Hooke</b> in 1665, the cell has a rich and interesting history that has ultimately given way to many of today’s scientific advancements.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-the-5-scientists-who-discovered-cells></span>Who are the 5 scientists who discovered cells?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Landmarks in Discovery of Cells<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th style=padding-left:0>Scientist</th><th>Discovery</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Robert Hooke</td><td>Discovered cells</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Anton Van Leuwenhoek</td><td>Discovered protozoa and bacteria</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Robert Brown</td><td>Discovered cell nucleus</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Albert Von Kolliker</td><td>Discovered mitochondria</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-study-of-tissue-called></span>What is the study of tissue called?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Tissues are composed of similar types of cells that work in a coordinated fashion to perform a common task, and the study of the tissue level of biological organization is <b>histology</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-accurate-is-a-cytology-test></span>How accurate is a cytology test?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Cytology was more accurate in detecting primary cancers <b>(sensitivity 77%, specificity 73%)</b> when compared to metastatic cancers (sensitivity 73%, specificity 100%). FNA was the most frequently used cytological technique to diagnose HBP lesions (sensitivity 78.8%).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-discovered-cell-byjus></span>Who discovered cell BYJU’s?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Robert Hooke Explanation. The cell was first discovered and named by <b>Robert Hooke</b> in 1665.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-is-the-largest-cell></span>Which is the largest cell?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>egg cell The largest cells is <b>an egg cell of ostrich</b>. The longest cell is the nerve cell. The largest cell in the human body is female ovum.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-smallest-cell></span>What is the smallest cell?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>mycoplasma <b>Bacteria mycoplasma</b> has the smallest cell. Its size is around 0.1 micrometers.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-cell-class8></span>What is cell class8?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Cells: The cell is <b>the basic structural and functional unit of life</b>. All living organisms are made up of cells. Cells make tissues, tissues make organs, organs make organ systems and organ systems make a living organism. Thus, the cell is the building block, or the structural unit of the living body.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-cell-class-11></span>What is Cell Class 11?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Class 11 cell is a part of NCERT Biology class 11. Cells are the atoms of human bodies. They form the basis of living organisms. New cells also arise from pre-existing cells. In simple terms, they can be defined as the <b>structural and functional unit of life</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-4-types-of-cells></span>What are the 4 types of cells?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>The Four Main Types of Cells</b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>Epithelial Cells.

While examining a section of a cork under the microscope, he observed small compartment-like structures and named them cells. … It is the smallest living unit of life.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-organ-byjus></span>What is organ BYJU’s?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>All living things are composed of cells, and a group of cells form tissues. These tissues combine to form organs, and the organs form an organ-system. The tissues perform simpler tasks, whereas, the organs <b>perform the complex functions of the body</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-cell></span>What is a cell?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In biology, <b>the smallest unit that can live on its own</b> and that makes up all living organisms and the tissues of the body.
