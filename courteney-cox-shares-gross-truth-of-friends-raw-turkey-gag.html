I’m feeling so thankful,” she said <a href=#>via Instagram</a> on November 26. “Also, if I get one more godd–n GIF with that turkey on my head dancing like a f–king fool, I’m just gonna snap.”</p><p>She added, “So, anyhow, since I’m the symbol of Thanksgiving, here you go. Hope it makes you happy.”</p><p>From there, Cox danced with the sunglasses-wearing turkey and set the clip to the sitcom’s theme song, “I’ll Be There for You” by The Rembrandts.</p><p>The <a href=#>Scream</a> star then <a href=#>took to Instagram</a> on Sunday, December 6, to reveal the “gross truth” about how she pulled off the act. In the hilarious clip, Cox kicked it off with a “Vegan Discretion Advised” message. The actress’ head was covered in plastic as she was then shown struggling to pull the large bird over her, despite getting some outside help from loved ones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Courteney-Cox-Shares-Gross-Truth-of-Friends-Raw-Turkey-Gag.gif?w=500&quality=86&strip=all"><p>Cox noted how “disgusting” the process was. “That hurts like a mother f–ker,” she added. “Hold on, I can’t breathe.”</p><p>In the Friends episode titled “The One With All the Thanksgivings,” Cox’s costar <a href=#><strong>Matt LeBlanc</strong></a>&nbsp;was also tasked with wearing a turkey on his head. However, former Friends writer <strong>Greg Malins</strong> previously revealed that the poultry item was not real.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We wanted — I especially wanted — a real turkey, just because I wanted Matt to have to put his head into a turkey,” the TV producer, 53, told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2016. “The prop department did their due diligence, but it didn’t exist. The biggest turkey ever for sale is not big enough to fit a human head. I remember them coming to us and saying, ‘We have to build it.’ So, we made it out of foam.”</p><p>Cox and LeBlanc, 53, are set to reunite with their former castmates <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></a>, &nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Matthew Perry</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>David Schwimmer</strong></a> for <a href=#>an HBO Max special</a>. Though it was initially set to film this year, the project <a href=#>was pushed back to March 2021</a> due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqoraKpsq%2Bx2GaaqLBdqLWivsSsZKCqn6jAbsDRrquhZZ%2Bbeqe%2ByJ6lnatdp664edOuqaSdqWK0orOO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
