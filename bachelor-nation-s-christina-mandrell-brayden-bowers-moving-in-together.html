She was ultimately <a href=#>sent home by Zach</a>, 27, during the season’s third episode after going on a one-on-one date with the leading man the week prior.</p><p>Brayden, for his part, made waves as the main villain of <strong>Charity Lawson</strong>’s season 20 of The Bachelorette. After butting heads with several contestants, he self-eliminated during the fourth episode. Brayden made his BiP debut during the show’s season 9 premiere in September 2023 and formed a strong connection with <strong>Kat Izzo</strong>, who also appeared on Zach’s Bachelor season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bachelor-Nations-Christina-Mandrell-Reveals-She-and-Boyfriend-Brayden-Bowers-Are-Moving-in-Together2.jpg><p>Their romance fizzled out after Kat, 27, decided to pursue relationships with other contestants. Brayden moved on by sparking connections with castmates such as <strong>Rachel Recchia</strong> and <strong>Becca Serrano</strong>, but he found himself being sent home after both women chose to <a href=#>self-eliminate</a>.</p><p>Since the BiP finale, Christina and Brayden have continuously <a href=#>gushed about each</a> other via social media. “AHHH! We can ‘FINALEy’ shout it from the rooftops!! Beyond the cameras and reality show drama, Brayden (aka MY BOYFRIEND!) and I found something truly special,” Christina captioned a sweet <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> video of herself, Brayden and her daughter enjoying quality time on a boat in December 2023. “In each other, we have a space where being unapologetically ourselves is not just accepted but celebrated! Something I never knew I was missing until I did. We can finally share our goofy, love-filled world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bachelor-Nations-Christina-Mandrell-Reveals-She-and-Boyfriend-Brayden-Bowers-Are-Moving-in-Together5.jpg><p>She also hinted at their move in the post’s caption, writing, “San Diego to Nashville won’t be just a change of scenery but the next chapter in our journey as a team. A future where laughter, authenticity, and the strength of ‘US’ define our story.”</p><p>Brayden, meanwhile, called Christina the “biggest blessing in my life” in a December 2023 <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> upload, which featured clips of them hanging out. “She has been there for me through very tough times already and has showed me so much grace through it all. She has become my confidant, my accountability partner, and my favorite person,” he wrote. “I’m so grateful that I no longer have to be hush-hush about our relationship. I can finally shout it from the tops of the mountains. Love you babe thank you [for] being in my life 😘❤️.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270WalmqyZpLu0ecKhqaKrpJ67onnMmqWdqpWhuW6u0ZqwnZ2eYq%2Bww8Srqmaln6u2r7OMoqVmrJ%2BcsrW0xKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
