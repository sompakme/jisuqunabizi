American Pie was a box-office hit. The film and its actors won countless awards, such as a Blockbuster Entertainment Award, a Golden Screen Award, and Young Hollywood Awards. The film and its actors also received countless award nominations, including MTV Movie Awards, Teen Choice Awards, and&nbsp;an American Comedy Award.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first movie in the series, American Pie, followed five friends who made a secret pact before their high school graduation. After American Pie’s success, three other films were made, including American Pie 2 (2001), American Wedding (2003) and American Reunion (2012). In addition, four American Pie film spin-offs were also made, including American Pie Presents: Band Camp (2005), The Naked Mile (2006), Beta House (2007) and The Book of Love (2009).</p><p>Most people who have watched all the films in the series will agree that it was not only interesting to follow the plot and see how the characters developed and grew up, but also seeing how the actors changed over the years. This change was probably best seen in American Reunion, since the film was released eight years after the third film (American Wedding) was made.</p><p>Curious to see how the actors have changed since then? Then have a look below where we take a look at&nbsp;20 American&nbsp;Pie actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alyson-hannigan>Alyson Hannigan</h2><p>The actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alyson Hannigan</a>&nbsp;is probably best known for her role as Michelle Flaherty in the American Pie series. It was Hannigan’s character, Michelle, who uttered probably the most famous line in the series: “And this one time, at band camp—.”</p><p>Hannigan&nbsp;has appeared in all four American Pie movies, even though at the beginning she did not expect to act in more than one American Pie&nbsp;film. “In the contract for the first one it was just a scale-plus-ten, it was a minor part.” Then she learned that her contract had a sequel clause. “I was like, ‘My character wouldn’t be in the sequel because she leaves at the end.' I totally did not expect ever to be in more than just the first one.”</p><h2 id=seann-william-scott>Seann William Scott</h2><p>The actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seann William Scott</a> played Steve Stifler in the American Pie series. Steve Stifler is one of the main five characters who appeared in all films in the series. Stifler is a lovable character and it was this role that brought the actor Sean William Scott international fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scott has said that he got lucky in getting the role – “The Stifler character was only in two or three scenes, and he was written to be kind of an unlikeable d-ck. I thought, 'I’m&nbsp;22 and I look like I’m 40. There’s no way I’m going to be cast in this thing anyway, and I’m not funny, so I might as well just play around with the dialogue a bit and make him a combination of a bunch of kids I went to school with, and make him the guy you’re not supposed to love, but you just do.' I got lucky — they liked what I did and I got the job.”</p><h2 id=tara-reid>Tara Reid</h2><p>The actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara Reid</a> played the character Victoria Lathum, better known as just “Vicky”, in the American Pie series. Reid appeared in three American Pie&nbsp;movies – American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Reunion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked whether she had any fears of going back to playing Vicky in American Reunion, the actress replied – “No. I’ve always liked Vicky and I’ve grown up with her. I started&nbsp;13 years ago with Vicky, and she’s been in my heart ever since. So, it was a lot of fun, going back and playing her again... I feel like this movie really picks back up from the original and stays true to the characters.”</p><h2 id=thomas-ian-nicholas>Thomas Ian Nicholas</h2><p>The actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Ian Nicholas</a> is probably best known for his role of Kevin Meyers in the American Pie film series. In the first American Pie movie, Kevin is the guy who comes up with 'the pact'.</p><p>When asked to recall what he thought about the American Pie Reunion film idea, Nicholas said, “When I first heard the rumblings of it, even four years ago, that there was this idea that we might do a reunion, I was excited and I thought it would be fun. I just thought it would be very difficult to bring everyone’s schedules together, and I was curious if everyone would want to reprise their roles. I was surprised to find out that everyone had a special place in their heart for their character and this franchise, as I did.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=natasha-lyonne>Natasha Lyonne</h2><p>The actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natasha Lyonne</a> played Jessica in the American Pie film series. Jessica was Vicky’s more experienced friend. Lyonne appeared in three American Pie movies – American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Reunion. However, she played only a minor role in American Pie 2, and in American Reunion Lyonne had only a cameo appearance. Lyonne did not appear in American Wedding.</p><p>In an interview, Lyonne said that she was nervous about returning on set for American Reunion. She said that she had “that feeling of ‘Oh, God, what are they all going to look like?” But, according to her, “everyone was really nice.”</p><h2 id=mena-suvari>Mena Suvari</h2><p>The beautiful actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mena Suvari </a>played the innocent choir girl Heather in the American Pie movie series. Suvari appeared in three American Pie movies – American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Reunion. Like many other original American Pie actors, she did not appear in the third American Pie movie, American Wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked if it was weird to do another American Pie movie after such a long period of time, Suvari replied, “We watched a clip from a photo shoot that we had done for Rolling Stone, so long ago, and it’s strange because, for me, when I heard about this idea and then went to Universal for our table read for American Reunion, even if we haven’t seen each other over the years, in five or&nbsp;10 minutes, everybody is right back on the same page and it’s like no time has passed, but then it has and it’s been so many years.”</p><h2 id=eugene-levy>Eugene Levy</h2><p>The talented actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eugene Levy</a> played Noah Levenstein in the American Pie series. Noah Levenstein is Jim Levenstein’s geeky dad. Levy’s character is the only character that appeared in all eight American Pie series films (the original series and the spin-off).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview&nbsp;for&nbsp;American Reunion, Levy was asked whether he thought that the characters changed a lot over the years, to which he replied, “From my perspective, I haven’t noticed too much of a change in these characters. They’re all pretty much the way I remember them, in the first American Pie. Yeah, some of them are married now, in the story, but they all basically look the same to me. They all look pretty good.”</p><h2 id=jason-biggs>Jason Biggs</h2><p>The American Pie series character James Emanuel Levenstein, better known as Jim, was portrayed by the actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Biggs</a>. The actor acted in all four American Pie movies – American Pie, American Pie 2, American Wedding, and American Reunion – and needless to say, has changed quite a lot over the series.</p><p>Biggs has said, “Everyone is like, 'Wow, you guys haven’t changed. You guys look the same.' And I’m like, 'Thank you?' But then you see the pictures at the end and you’re like, 'Oh, wait, yeah, actually you have changed.' Well, yeah, it’s been thirteen years. And even those first three movies, we turned them out in pretty quick succession. This time around, it was a good eight years.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shannon-elizabeth>Shannon Elizabeth</h2><p>The actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shannon Elizabeth</a> played the beautiful foreign exchange student from Czechoslovakia, Nadia. Shannon Elizabeth appeared in three American Pie films – American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Reunion. She was absent from American Wedding.</p><p>Shannon Elizabeth said it was a lot of fun to shoot American Reunion. “When the old cast got back together for American Reunion, it felt like a high school reunion for all of us. The mood on set was a lot of fun. Everybody was joking around, having a good time. The only difference is now people have iPads. We didn't have iPads before, that was it. I don't think anyone has changed, we all just look like adults now. I look back at the first film and they all look like little babies!"</p><h2 id=eddie-kaye-thomas>Eddie Kaye Thomas</h2><p>The actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie Kaye Thomas</a> played Paul Finch, better known as just Finch, in the American Pie&nbsp;film series. Finch is a nice guy who is rather intellectual and philosophical, which makes it hard for him to get girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thomas has appeared in all four American Pie movies – American Pie, American Pie 2, American Wedding, and American Reunion. Thomas first found out about the possibility of another American Pie movie on the internet. “The first time I heard about it, I actually heard about it like everybody else, on the Internet and stuff, when it became official. I had heard so many rumors about it, with people telling me there was going to be another American Pie, and I would say, 'Well, if there's going to be another American Pie, I think I would know about it.' And then I read about it online, and realized it was true.”</p><h2 id=jennifer-coolidge>Jennifer Coolidge</h2><p>The actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Coolidge</a> played Jeanine Stifler, Stifler’s mom, in the American Pie movie series. Many boys fantasized about Jeanine Stifler in the series, who is supposedly the original MILF. The actress appeared in all four American Pie films – American Pie, American Pie 2, American Wedding, and American Reunion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview, Coolidge said that she loved the idea of American Reunion&nbsp;but had her own suggestions as to how to make it better. “I thought I should sleep with Finch one last time before I do some other stuff. I did want that to happen. I was very firm about it.”</p><h2 id=ali-cobrin>Ali Cobrin</h2><p>Unlike most other actors who played in American Reunion, Ali Cobrin did not appear in the first three American Pie movies. Cobrin only appeared in the fourth American Pie movie:&nbsp;American Reunion.</p><p>In American Reunion, Cobrin plays an attractive girl next door named Kara. It turns out that Jim used to babysit Kara when she was younger, although Jim did not recognize her at first. In the film, Kara just turned 18 years old. She tries to seduce Jim at her 18 birthday party, but Jim turns her&nbsp;down. Unfortunately, he doesn't get a chance to explain himself or tell her that he’s married until later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-klein>Chris Klein</h2><p>The easygoing Christopher Ostreicher, better known as Oz, from the American Pie series is played by the actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Klein</a>. Klein appeared in three American Pie movies – American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Reunion. He was left out from the third American Pie movie, American Wedding.</p><p>However, Klein was not upset about being left out from the American Wedding and jumped at the chance of acting in the American Pie series again. “These movies to me, personally, are incredibly special. As not only a willing participant in these movies, but also as an audience member. And I cherish my moments in the 'American Pie' franchise and I’m really grateful that I get to be a part of it. Because back in 1998 when we made the first movie, we were all just hoping to get a summer job. And then American Pie did well and all of us were ushered into acting careers based on the success of the very first movie.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katrina-bowden>Katrina Bowden</h2><p>The actress Katrina Bowden played the superficial model Mia in American Reunion. Bowden did not appear in the previous three American Pie films, American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Wedding. Her very first appearance was in American Reunion.</p><p>In American Reunion, Mia was Oz’s supermodel girlfriend. She was one of the antagonists in the film. She was portrayed as superficial and promiscuous.</p><p>Bowden was probably the hottest actress on American Reunion film set. Before American Reunion she had been cast in many sexy roles and in 2011 the actress was voted as Sexiest Woman Alive by Esquire Magazine.</p><h2 id=dania-ramirez>Dania Ramirez</h2><p>The actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dania Ramirez</a> played Selena Vega, Michelle’s best friend, in the film&nbsp;American Reunion. Dania Ramirez was not part of the original American Pie cast and thus did not appear in the first three American Pie films, American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview, Ramirez revealed how she got involved in the American Pie franchise. “When I was filming Premium Rush in NYC I flew to LA to have a few general meetings. I sat down with Peter Cramer at Universal Studios and spoke about my life and career and being that I’m such a goof, we spoke about how I really wanted to do a comedy next. I think it is always important to showcase your talent in different ways. A few months after that meeting I got a call from my agent, Carter Cohn, saying I had the offer to be a part of&nbsp;American Reunion. I was so excited too, being that I was a huge fan of the franchise!”</p><h2 id=john-cho>John Cho</h2><p>The actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Cho</a> played John, also known as just MILF Guy #2, in the American Pie series. Cho played in all four American Pie films. He played a minor character in American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Wedding. He played a major supporting character in American Reunion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cho has said that the fame he encountered after American Pie shocked him. "I was out of the country, shooting another movie, and had missed the release of American Pie, and was unaware it was a really big hit. So I came back to America, and kids were chanting 'MILF! MILF!' at me on the street. And I was really confused, and it took me a while to understand what was happening actually."</p><h2 id=chris-owen>Chris Owen</h2><p>The actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Owen</a> famously played Chuck Sherman, better known as "The Sherminator", in the American Pie film series. He appeared in all four American Pie films, American Pie, American Pie 2, American Wedding, and American Reunion.</p><p>While Chris Owen became rather famous for his role in the American Pie series, it seems that his acting career was not going so well after the American Pie series came to an end. Owen's appearance has changed rather drastically; today he is an incredibly handsome man and resembles a hipster!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vik-sahay>Vik Sahay</h2><p>The actor Vik Sahay played Prateek Duraiswamy, Stifler’s mean and vengeful boss in American Reunion. Unlike most other actors, Sahay did not appear in the first three films of the American Pie series:&nbsp;American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Wedding. He only appeared in American Reunion.</p><p>When asked how he liked working on the movie, Sahay replied, “Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have written one of, if not the, best scripts of the series. And I kept expecting to meet Stifler off camera, but Seann is a great, smart guy, and a real pro. It was a fantastic experience. I just hope I added a little spice in that American Pie, one dark little clove baked in under the crust.”</p><h2 id=robert-hayes>Robert Hayes</h2><p>The actor Robert Hayes played Bo in&nbsp;American Reunion. Hayes did not appear in the first three American Pie films, American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Wedding. He only appeared in the fourth American Pie film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hayes loved working on the set of the American Reunion, saying,&nbsp;“With American Pie being the top comedic franchise in history, the cast and crew constantly cracked jokes in between takes, pulled pranks on each other, and laughed our brains out after we filmed most of the scenes because they were just so funny. Seann William Scott brought a certain type of energy to the set that I feel nobody had the capability of bringing.”</p><h2 id=jay-harrington>Jay Harrington</h2><p>The actor Jay Harrington played Dr. Ron in the latest American Pie movie, American Reunion. Unlike most actors who played in the film, Harrington did not appear in the first three American Pie movies, American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Wedding. He only appeared in American Reunion.</p><p>Apart from appearing in the latest American Pie film, American Reunion, Harrington has also had roles in Better Off Ted, the TV comedy Hot In Cleveland (where he played Valerie Bertinelli’s love interest), Guilty, and Desperate Housewives. Fun fact: on the TV show Desperate Housewives, Harrington played a character that was also called “Dr. Ron”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWawoJGpenN8jKyrmqqjYrynecCmnKuhk5a7brzInmSlp5%2Bgeq21yp5kp6enZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
