Elsewhere in the night, Wheeler Yuta and Komander will go at it in a Pure Rules Match for the ROH Pure Championship.</p><p>Anna Jay and Hikaru Shida will also face off in singles action, and Kris Statlander & Willow Nightingale will compete in tag team action.</p><p>The results are as follows:</p><p>Things started off with a big trios match, and in it Briscoe and The Hardys walked out on top. Things came to an end after The Hardys got in a flurry of finishers against their opponents, with Jeff hitting the Swanton Bomb on Kip after Matt hit him with the Twist of Fate.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Jericho promised to be ready for Big Bill if he tried to interfere in Guevara and Ricky Starks’ match next week on Dynamite.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Anna said that she has to to be able to beat Hikaru shida by herself tonight, before Harley Cameron showed up and said that she wants to help all of them. Harley then whispered something into Angelo’s ear, which seemed to intrigue him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>This one ended almost immediately, with Nightingale and Statlander walking out with a big win after Willow hit a spinebuster.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The brothers want to get back on Dynamite to help boost the show’s rating, but Private Party interrupted them before they could say much more. Matt said he’s proud they’re doing their own thing, then teased a potential future match before throwing some shirts at them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Despite needing a win, Anna Jay was unable to walk out on top here. To her credit, Jay controlled most of the match, but things fell apart for her after Shida got out of the Queen Slayer, and then hit the Katana for the pin and win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Jarrett and his crew were arguing backstage, with Jarrett calling Jay Lethal a loser. Jay said that Jeff needs to start winning his own matches, before demanding he leave the area, while Sonjay and Karen tried to keep the peace between the two of them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Yuta defended his ROH Pure Championship with a stellar win tonight. Toward the end of the match, Yuta was able to snatch back momentum after Komander looked to walk away with a win. Eventually, Wheeler would get back on top of Komander and hit him with a series of elbows, before locking in a double wrist lock to force Komander to tap out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsa21sY2KupsOMq5imqJGcsm6%2BxKyspayjYn5ugYxramasmJp6qa3RnbCsZZGjsW65zquc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
