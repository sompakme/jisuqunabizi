Quotes and video are below:</p><p>Dave Bautista on what’s it like to finally be playing the role as Marcus Fenix:</p><p>“It feels great. Especially since I’ve been pursuing the film role version of Marcus Fenix for like 10 years now.”</p><p>On the ease of working with gaming producer Rod Fergusson on the project:</p><p>“For one I was excited to work with him, but also when you don’t have any visual references you don’t have anything but some lines out in front of you, but it’s hard to put emotion into those lines, but Rod made it so easy because he was so descriptive, you could tell that he knows this game inside and out, obviously because it’s his baby, but he just made it really easy for me to do what I needed to do to perform.”</p><p>On how he’ll be used in Gears of War 5:</p><p>“It’ll be completely replaced Marcus Fenix. It will be my image and my voice will be as close to me as playing the part as possible on video game.</p><p>“Then we make just a lot of wrestling references, especially to you know all the “Animal” stuff and “Smackdown” stuff and all that stuff. So it’s just a lot of good references for that. I think the fans will really appreciate it. I do I’m getting a kick out of it, thinking about it.”</p><p>(Transcription credit should go to of WrestleZone)</p><p>YYYYEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!! Tyler Breeze (a.k.a.
