The HSI Professional Glider Hair Straightener comes with everything you need to get started when straightening your hair. You have the hair straightener itself, as well as a velvet case to carry the device around. There’s also a glove that you can use to make it easier to work with the hair straightener, and you even get a pack of Argan oil to protect your hair from the heat. Aside from the comprehensive kit that you get with your purchase, this hair straightener for thick hair is quite effective. It’s got micro sensors that ensure you don’t damage your hair in the long run. Though it’s called a hair straightener, you can use this tool to curl your hair as well. It’s the best overall choice on this list for those who want salon-grade results at home.</p><p><span>2</span></p><h3 class=product-title><a href=#>NITION Hair Straightener</a></h3><h4 class=pros-cons__title>Pros</h4><ul class=product-pros__list><li class=product-pros__list-item>Lots of extras</li><li class=product-pros__list-item>Digital temperature display</li><li class=product-pros__list-item>Comes in two colors</li></ul><h4 class=pros-cons__title>Cons</h4><ul class=product-cons__list><li class=product-cons__list-item>Not beginner-friendly</li></ul><p>The previous product contained a kit full of neat little accessories, but it still felt like it was lacking a bit in some areas. This Nition Pro Hair Straightener, however, has everything you need to straighten your hair quickly and effectively. This hair straightener for thick hair kit comes with plenty of extras that you’ll want to use alongside the straightener. You have a glove, a comb, hair clips, and a carrying pouch, so you can prepare your hair for the actual straightening process. This hair straightener for thick hair has this almost futuristic design to it that makes it look very different from other hair straighteners. With a digital display that showcases the temperature of the iron, you can tell exactly how hot the device is, allowing you to fine-tune the heat just right so that it won’t damage your hair. It may not be ideal for those new to using hair straighteners, but for those who know what they’re doing, it’s a great choice.</p><p><span>3</span></p><h3 class=product-title><a href=#>VANESSA PRO Hair Straightener</a></h3><h4 class=pros-cons__title>Pros</h4><ul class=product-pros__list><li class=product-pros__list-item>Features a long plate</li><li class=product-pros__list-item>Durable material quality</li><li class=product-pros__list-item>Convenient temperature indicator</li></ul><h4 class=pros-cons__title>Cons</h4><ul class=product-cons__list><li class=product-cons__list-item>No accessories included</li></ul><p>If you want a high-quality hair straightener that you can use for months to come, this is a product worth considering. The Vanessa Pro Flat Iron Straightener has what the company claims to be the “world’s longest plate”. With such a claim, you’d think that the device would be extremely unique or different from other hair straighteners, but in reality, it looks like any other hair straightener. The long plate does matter, however, as you can cover more hair per stroke than with other hot tools. Length aside, this hair straightener for thick hair has a couple of other things worth noting. The device comes with a digital temperature indicator, which makes it easier for you to control just how hot the iron will be. You can also use the straightener with all hair types, so it’s great for sharing with others. While the product doesn’t come with any additional accessories, it’s still a great product overall.</p><p><span>4</span></p><h3 class=product-title><a href=#>CHI Hair Straightener</a></h3><h4 class=pros-cons__title>Pros</h4><ul class=product-pros__list><li class=product-pros__list-item>Heats up quickly</li><li class=product-pros__list-item>Salon-grade straightener</li><li class=product-pros__list-item>High-quality construction</li></ul><h4 class=pros-cons__title>Cons</h4><ul class=product-cons__list><li class=product-cons__list-item>Somewhat pricey option</li></ul><p>Hair straighteners can vary in quality from brand to brand, and while this next straightener may lack some features, it does make up for this in other ways. The first thing you may notice with the Chi Original Ceramic Hair Straightener is that it has no temperature indicator. This means that you won’t really know the temperature of the hair straightener, nor can you tune it, though the brand does mention that the device can heat up quickly. To make the most out of this hair straightener for thick hair, you’ll want to use something to protect your hair. After all, hair straighteners can damage your hair in the long run, so using hair products to mitigate this can go a long way. Chi also sells hair products made to go alongside their hair straightener, and while this can end up costing you quite a bit of money, it may be worth every penny if you like the results.</p><p><span>5</span></p><h3 class=product-title><a href=#>Conair Hair Straightener</a></h3><h4 class=pros-cons__title>Pros</h4><ul class=product-pros__list><li class=product-pros__list-item>Very affordable price</li><li class=product-pros__list-item>Comes in two sizes</li><li class=product-pros__list-item>Easy-to-use digital interface</li></ul><h4 class=pros-cons__title>Cons</h4><ul class=product-cons__list><li class=product-cons__list-item>Material quality could be better</li></ul><p>Hair straighteners can be pretty expensive a purchase, and when you don’t have a whole lot of money to spend on hair products and devices, it can be difficult to afford a hair straightener.
