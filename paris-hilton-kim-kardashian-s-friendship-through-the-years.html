Both of the Hollywood superstars grew up in Los Angeles. “Paris and I have been friends since we were kids,” the<a href=#> Keeping Up With the Kardashians </a>alum shared in an interview on the <a href=#>Today </a>show in April 2008.</p><p>Their friendship was first documented on Hilton and <a href=#><strong>Nicole Richie’s</strong></a> reality show, The Simple Life, which began airing in 2003. The Confessions of an Heiress author was a client of Kardashian’s, who had a closet organizing business.</p><p>However, after the former Dash owner’s career took off following the release of her sex tape with <a href=#><strong>Ray J</strong></a> and the premiere of Keeping up With the Kardashians in 2007, Hilton and the Selfish author’s friendship seemed to fizzle out.</p><p>The <a href=#>“This is Paris”</a> podcast host dissed Kardashian in a radio show interview in 2008: “I would not want [Kim’s butt] – it’s gross! It reminds me of cottage cheese inside a big trash bag.”</p><p>Although Hilton issued a formal apology, the two seemed to drift apart. In 2011, Kardashian said that she had drifted apart from her former best friend.</p><p>“We don’t really talk. As I always say, everyone comes into your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. And she was in my life for a long time,” the Skims founder explained to <a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a> at the time. “There comes a point in life where you just grow apart and realize you’re not as similar as you thought. And I never run into her anywhere. Isn’t that so weird?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After years of not speaking, the pair reunited at <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner’s</strong></a> Christmas Eve party in 2016 and posed for a photo together. Since then, the two have appeared to remain friends with the Paris in Love star appearing in a <a href=#>fall 2020 Skims campaign</a> and the “Jam (Turn It Up)” singer <a href=#>attending Hilton’s wedding</a> to <strong>Carter Reum</strong> in November 2021.</p><p>Scroll down to take a look back on the ups and downs of Hilton and Kardashian’s friendship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvaK%2ByKxkoaGcqbyvecqipGajkaexor%2FHopinq12bv6qxzZ2qoaGgYsGpvs6unqFlpJ2ybsXEmqmsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
