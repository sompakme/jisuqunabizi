She believes the network encouraged racist behavior and fostered an uncomfortable work environment. NeNe Leakes, whose legal name is Linnethia Monique Leakes, spent seven seasons as one of the most popular stars of The Real Housewives of Atlanta between 2008 and 2020.</p><p>The popular former The Real Housewives of Atlanta cast member has just started legal proceedings against both the network and production companies responsible for the show. Andy Cohen is included in the accused parties, a shocking allegation as the pair have appeared to be close friends over their years working together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So what is all this legal drama about, and why is this quick-witted, beloved star of the reality TV franchise suing the people behind it? We delve further into this lawsuit, what caused it and why NeNe Leakes is suing Andy Cohen and <strong><a href=#>The Real Housewives</a></strong> TV franchise.</p><h2 id=did-bravo-encourage-racist-behavior><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Did Bravo Encourage Racist Behavior?</span></h2><p>The American TV personality has alleged that the network, production companies and executives involved not only allowed racist attitudes but encouraged this type of offensive behavior. As per court documents, NeNe Leakes has accused the show’s production teams of “[fostering] a corporate and workplace culture in which racially insensitive and inappropriate behaviour is tolerated – if not encouraged”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-zolciak-biermann-mentioned-in-nene-leakes-39-court-documents><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kim Zolciak-Biermann Mentioned In NeNe Leakes' Court Documents</span></h2><p>NeNe Leakes' cast mate and on/off friend Kim Zolciak-Biermann is not being sued, but her name appears multiple times throughout the lawsuit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Does Kim Zolciak Speak To Any Of Her Former ‘RHOA’ Castmates?">Does Kim Zolciak Speak To Any Of Her Former ‘RHOA’ Castmates?</a></span></p><p>Over their years working together on the reality show, Leakes has accused Zolciak-Biermann (and in one instance her daughter Brielle) of racially offensive behavior including comments made during the show’s production as well as online. The lawsuit claims that Leakes attempted to address these issues with the show’s executives but was unsuccessful.</p><h2 id=nene-leakes-believes-she-is-target-of-systematic-racism><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>NeNe Leakes Believes She Is Target Of Systematic Racism</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>NeNe Leakes’ lawyer David deRubertis explained that at the crux of the case was that “Nene was the target of systemic racism from co-star Kim Zolciak-Biermann, which was tolerated by Bravo executive producer Andy Cohen and other executives.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online reported that NeNe Leakes exposed emails</a> from the show’s executives saying that calling out the behavior of her fellow housewives would be “bad for business”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Here's How The Cast Of 'Real Housewives Of Atlanta' Feel About NeNe Leakes And Her Rumored Return">Here's How The Cast Of 'Real Housewives Of Atlanta' Feel About NeNe Leakes And Her Rumored Return</a></span></p><p>The lawsuit further also reveals that not only was Zolciak-Biermann’s behavior tolerated, it was even rewarded. “Nene says she complained to Andy Cohen and producers – who instead of firing Kim gave her a spin-off.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-made-racist-comments-39-rhoa-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kim Made Racist Comments 'RHOA'</span></h2><p>The paperwork obtained alleges that during the first season of the reality show, which aired in 2008, the cast was planning to attend a barbecue, and housewife Kim Zolciak-Biermann, responded to the idea with “words to the effect of: "I don’t want to sit around with NeNe and eat chicken.’”</p><p>The suit says the statement “perpetuated an offensive stereotype about African-Americans.”</p><p>In another incident, during the fifth season, Zolciak-Biermann made “racially offensive and stereotypical” comments about the new home of housewife Kandi Burruss, calling her neighborhood a “ghetto” and perpetuating a racial stereotype when asking whether Burruss needed to have a swimming pool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-nene-leakes-left-39-rhoa-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why NeNe Leakes Left 'RHOA'</span></h2><p>Another significant complaint made in the lawsuit includes NeNe Leakes' revealing that the show's executives were partly responsible <a href=#>for her forced exit from the show in 2020.</a> At the time, the Black Lives Matter movement was dominating the news, with Leakes being an outspoken and active supporter.</p><p>The show’s executives are accused of silencing Leakes and stopping her from addressing the BLM movement on the Bravo reality TV show. The lawsuit accuses the show’s production of violating American federal employment and anti-discrimination laws.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Ratings For ‘RHOA’ Are Dropping Since Nene Leakes’ Departure, But Will Bravo Bring Her Back?">Ratings For ‘RHOA’ Are Dropping Since Nene Leakes’ Departure, But Will Bravo Bring Her Back?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“As the Black Lives Matter movement swept our nation, Mrs. Leakes — Bravo’s historically most successful Black female talent — should have been embraced by NBC, Bravo, and True,” the suit says. “Instead, NBC, Bravo, and True forced her out of the ‘house she built,’ denying her a regular role.”</p><h2 id=andy-cohen-and-nene-leakes-have-fractured-friendship><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Andy Cohen and Nene Leakes Have Fractured Friendship</span></h2><p>Things have been tense between NeNe Leakes and Andy Cohen for some time, so it's no surprise that he is mentioned in her lawsuit.</p><p>In an interview with Entertainment Tonight back in October 2020, she spoke about her relationship with Cohen, "Well, I thought that we had a relationship and a great relationship. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But maybe we didn't. I don't know."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After announcing her departure from The Real Housewives of Atlanta earlier in 2020, she tweeted at Andy Cohen: "@Andy said he respected Teddi [Mellencamp] for telling the truth about her exit. Well i can’t wait to tell my truths i hope i get just as much respect." And after a fan asked on Twitter whether the network forced NeNe to leave, she responded with, “They definitely did.”</p><p>“Keep trying me sir and imma let the world know who you really are,” she later tweeted, which many people felt was directed at the host and producer. “The racist is the master manipulator!
