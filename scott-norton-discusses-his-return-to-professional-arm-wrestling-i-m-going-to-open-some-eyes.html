When you’re done you’ve got this empty feeling and you’re looking for this adrenaline rush again. I was watching the <a href=#>WAL</a> on ESPN and I see these guys and I’m going, “If I go back to work I think I can stick these kids.” So I did. I’ve been really hitting it hard for about a year and a half now. I’ve got some injuries that I’ve got to train through but my wrist, hand and forearms are better than they’ve ever been. My upper arm strength is coming along and I may not be the “Old Flash” but believe me when I say I’m going to open some eyes.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Eric and Nick start the show off by talking about Goldberg’s old school 86 second squash match style victory over Brock Lesnar at Survivor Series.
