I firmly believe that there is a little kid who exists in all of us. As a child I was content with a jump-rope or a bottle cap to play street games such as “potsie” with. However, those who have the wealth to “live large” can truly acquire the most outrageously expensive “toys” I have ever seen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The super rich big boys and girls of the world are always looking for larger and better ways to spend their money.&nbsp;If they already have numerous beautiful homes in all their favorite locations, filled with luxury cars and a yacht or several of them one might think it could be difficult to come up with something new to put on their wish list but not so! That’s when it may be time to check out Hammacher Schlemmer – one of the world’s most exclusive innovators and keepers of toys for the very wealthy.</p><p>Their products appeal to the globally super-rich who never seem to be short of the dollars required to purchase all the latest expensive gadgets and gizmos. I’ll paraphrase a quote from one of my favorite films, “Field Of Dreams”, ‘if you build it, they will buy it’. Along with their rivals such as Brookstone and The Sharper Image, Hammacher Schlemmer has nabbed themselves a place in a niche market for the world’s wealthiest patrons, offering them innovative new ways to spend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These top ten items are so outrageous, unique and costly even the richest kids could never have conceived of their existence. Thus the wealthy are snapping up these elegant and expensive toys with exuberance and abandon. The moment a billionaire sets eyes on these baubles, they just have to have them.</p><h2 id=10-pac-man-cocktail-table---3-500-00><strong>10.&nbsp;Pac-Man Cocktail Table -&nbsp;$3,500.00</strong></h2><p>If they want a drink or a beer at days’ end why not become the proud owner of a $3,500.00 Pac-Man cocktail table. It commemorates the 30th anniversary of Pac-Man and is identical to the cabinets which were played in pizza parlors and malls since the 1980s. The console provides the same head-to-head game play, original graphics, and classic "Wocka, wocka, wocka" sound as the old arcade games had. Faithful details include a 19" LCD monitor that captures all nuances of the vintage graphics, removable decals, and deactivated coin doors. Includes 12 other iconic arcade games,—the perfect way to enjoy a sip and a little gaming fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-human-bowling-ball---4-500-00><strong>9.&nbsp;“Human” Bowling Ball -&nbsp;$4,500.00</strong></h2><p>For bowling fans who literally want to get into the game, but are tired of renting ugly shoes at the local alley, there is The “Human” Bowling Ball, the inflatable bowling game that challenges players to assume the "roll" of the ball in knocking down a set of pins. The transparent PVC ball is inflated to its full 7' diameter with the included blower¿a zipper cinches the ball closed yet opens quickly to allow egress and quick entry for another player. A player simply runs forward inside the ball, generating momentum to knock over six 5'-tall foam pins that yield easily at the point of collision. Its rip- and tear-resistant vinyl construction withstands years of play, and resists mold and fading. This one is priced at $4,500.00.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-portable-inflatable-waterslide--8-000-00><strong>8. Portable Inflatable Waterslide-&nbsp;$8,000.00</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If water sports are on the menu, how about a portable inflatable water slide for a mere $8000.00? The resilient structure defies punctures as it is constructed of a layer of commercial-grade, 1,000 denier polyester fabric sandwiched between two layers of 28 oz. PVC--the same method used to construct the inflatable boats used by the U.S. Navy Seals. Every strong seam is hot-air sealed, and the PVC is treated to block damaging UV rays. No more piling the children into the limousine and having the chauffer drive them to a water park. Just set this baby up in your private marina or lake and family and friends can splash and slide to their heart’s content.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-barbecue-dining-boat--8-000-00><strong>7.&nbsp;Barbecue Dining Boat-&nbsp;$8,000.00&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Continuing the wet and wild theme is this $8,000.00 barbecue/dining boat with a built-in barbecue grill, umbrella, and trolling motor that provides waterborne cookouts for up to 10 adults. The boat's 24"-diameter steel charcoal grill is surrounded by a table with 10 place settings that each have a recessed plate holder, three beverage holders, and silverware tray. Six compartments beneath seats store food and supplies for all-day cookouts. The 11'-diameter nylon umbrella can be retracted when using the grill. Its 30-watt electric trolling motor enables operators to maneuver up to 2 1/2 mph through calm water and alongside docks for loading/unloading. The owner of this model can invite friends or treat family to burgers or maybe grilled filet mignon, as it seats 10. Ah, pass the mustard please, relish anyone?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-1965-mustang-car-pool-table--9-995-00><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;1965 Mustang Car Pool Table-&nbsp;$9,995.00</strong></h2><p>As we all know, games are for people of all ages and wealthy folks are no different than the rest of us. If they have a penchant for classic American cars and enjoy a good game of pool than the $9,995.00 1965 Mustang Car Pool Table is a must for them. Directly molded from the body of an original 1965 Ford Mustang and finished in a state-of-the-art body shop, this pool table's exterior is painted in the original Rangoon Red color, clear coated, and then wet sanded to a mirror-like finish. Working front and rear lights, polished chrome bumpers, real alloy rims and tires, plus a professional slate top make this pool table one of the most unique collectibles you'll ever own.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-whac-a-mole-bar---35-000-00><strong>5.&nbsp;Whac-A-Mole bar -$35,000.00</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If your nostalgia takes you back to your long ago and far away childhood days of hanging out at the arcade, then the Whac-A-Mole bar, priced at $35,000.00 is for you. This is the Whac-A-Mole game that can be personalized to replace the standard mole heads with molded caricatures using pictures of members of your family or whomever you want to personalize it with. The game operates exactly like the ones found in amusement parks and carnivals--five mole heads pop up randomly while you attempt to bash each with a mallet for points--but this one comes in a walnut veneer cabinet that automatically opens and closes at the touch of a button from the included remote. When closed, the game assumes the form of a bookshelf, but when commanded to open, both halves swing open to reveal the game, complete with full-color artwork. A storage shelf for your preferred beverages sits above the game, so libation is always at an arm's reach. Scoring is kept just as it is in the original game using a three-digit LCD. Built-in speakers provide authentic sound effects. Includes two padded leathermallets. Just stock the bar on the top and let the games begin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-light-cycle--50-000-00><strong>4.&nbsp;Light Cycle- $50,000.00</strong></h2><p>Wealthy people with a penchant for speed can ride quite stylishly on their very own Light Cycle for only $50,000.00. This is the illuminated, street-legal motorcycle inspired by the computer animated cycle from the 2010 film Tron: Legacy. It is designed for casual cruising and slow ride-bys. It is made from a steel frame covered by a fiberglass cowling that replicates the sleek look of its computer-generated imagery counterpart. Electroluminescent strips built into the tire cowlings, wheel rims, and body illuminate the cycle. It is powered by a fuel-injected Suzuki 996cc, 4-stroke engine. Riders lay at a near-horizontal position astride the padded leather seat, with feet on foot pegs that control its 6-speed constant mesh manual transmission and hands on the handlebars for throttle and braking. Hop on and ride off into the future.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-dream-folly-tent--75-000><strong>3. Dream Folly Tent- $75,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Find your own retreat space with style and panache. This tent is 18 feet in diameter with a mixed grain interior lattice system, Sunbrella exterior lining, and plexi-glass door and dome.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside there are exclusive upholstery pieces such as hand-crafted down-filled sequined pillows, and a very appealing hand-crafted chandelier which makes for a rather dreamy ambient interior.&nbsp;Anyone for a smore?</p><p></p><h2 id=2-sapphire-studded-iphone-case---100-000-00><strong>2.&nbsp;Sapphire-studded iPhone case - $100,000.00</strong></h2><p>Let’s face it--the platinum card members who reside in that exclusive one percent club love to show off their bling. So here’s a little something to put the sparkle in their eyes: a $100,000, sapphire-studded iPhone case. Made in the USA,&nbsp;&nbsp;the case features natural sapphires and rubies. It is exquisitely crafted of 18kt white gold and set with a total of 2,830 natural blue Ceylon sapphires, totalling 169.8 carats. The iconic Apple logo on this case is set with 38 natural rubies (total 2.28 carats) and the Apple leaf is done with a single marquise cut natural green sapphire. A great way to make sparkling conversation!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-gold-amp-jeweled-monopoly-game-board-2-000-000-00><strong>1. Gold & Jeweled Monopoly Game Board $2,000,000.00</strong></h2><p>The famous Parker Brothers classic board game is going Wall Street and with a $2 million price tag it is the world’s most costly game of Monopoly the buyer will ever play! It is a blinged-out version, made of 18-karat gold with a matching set of dice, encrusted with 42 diamonds, valued at $10,000.00. All of the properties are set in an additional 165 gemstones.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course not every millionaire with endless funds is seeking to blow it all on luxurious and expensive games and toys.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for the budget-conscious wealthy and their pocket-books, bargains exist and can be found. Take for instance two more reasonably priced options - a pair of electric roller skates or a backyard ice rink, each only $700.00 (not shown.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This journey has been an enlightening and interesting trip. These are but a fraction of the incredibly-priced creations specially designed and stocked for the wealthy population to spend their recreational dollars on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, I’ve never had that issue and have always been happy with whatever toys I was able to afford.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still examining the American dreams of the “one percent” has been both educational and a great deal of fun. Maybe one day you and I can join their ranks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2qubW1zJqrnmWkpMa0ecWoqWaqmZi1brPIq6OsZZGjsW6uzrKqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
