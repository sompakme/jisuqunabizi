Emily was very much a dream role for me, and I feel like my answer to that would be: I really hope I get to play her in a Season 2. I hope that I get to play Emily again. It’s so fun,” she said.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“It’s so tricky, though," she added, "to find the right [rom-com role], because you can be too stereotypical.

The main protagonist is best known for wearing bucket hats, 4-inch stilettos, and luxurious brands like Chanel, Dior, and Gucci.
