Only days before Jackass Forever is expected to hit theatres, <a href=#>several of the movie’s cast members</a> have been hit with a lawsuit following a stunt that went wrong.</p><p>Steve-O, Chris Pontius, and others from the film have been named in a lawsuit launched by Michael Vicens-Segura, who says he sustained life-altering head injuries after a stunt involving a jet ski didn’t go as planned. <a href=#>TMZ</a> reports that Vicens-Segura hopes to receive $12 million in damages, if his case is successful.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kanye West Drops $400,000 On A Luxury Mercedes Minivan</a></span></p><p>Court documents reveal that the Vicens-Segura was approached by the Jackass cast in 2018 in Puerto Rico when they asked if they could use his jet ski to film a stunt.</p><p>In what’s being described as a tug-of-war-style prank, the idea was to have the two stuntmen drive jet skis in opposite directions while attached by a long bungee cord to see who falls off first. TMZ notes they’ve performed similar stunts in the past, perhaps most famously their BMX Tug of War stunt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to choppy waters, Vicens-Segura was required to hold one of the jet skis steady in the water as they began the stunt. But, as his revealed in his lawsuit, things quickly went awry after the stuntmen stepped on the gas pedal.</p><p>The end of the bungee cord attached to Steve-O reportedly snapped off instantaneously, hitting Vicens-Segura in the process. At high speed, the cord hit the jet ski owner on the side of the head, leaving a severe head injury.</p><p><a href=#>Reports explain</a> that Vicens-Segura had to be air-lifted to a local hospital, where he underwent an emergency surgery and was subsequently placed in a medically-induced coma. His injuries included brain bleeding and a fracture skull.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, Vicens-Segura is seeking six-figures of compensation due to the life-altering nature of his injuries. His legal team claims that he’s unable to work due to chronic pain and subsequent trauma. He’s also been left with a variety of scars.</p><p>As of now, no representatives for Steve-O, Chris Pontius, or the Jackass franchise have responded to the controversy.</p><p>Vicens-Segura isn’t the only person to have become injured while filming a scene for Jackass Forever. Earlier this month, <a href=#>Johnny Knoxville</a> revealed<a href=#> he suffered brain damage</a> following a dangerous stunt for the upcoming movie.</p><p>During a new interview with Howard Stern, Knoxville says that a stunt involving him being thrown into the air by a bull resulted in a series of injuries, including broken ribs, a broken wrist, and a concussions that led to a brain haemorrhage. He added that he’s also experienced depression since incurring the injuries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Knoxville hinted he may be finished with pranks and stunts, saying that he's "done enough” and “no one in my family is happy” following his latest ill-fated stunt.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kris Jenner Refuses To Marry Corey Gamble To Protect Her $140 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Cinema Blend</a>, <a href=#>NME</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3oq%2FKmqqsZZakv6bCxKtkpqGcobawuoydpqWkkad6ra3WrKyirF2brqq4xJ1krKylo8Fw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
