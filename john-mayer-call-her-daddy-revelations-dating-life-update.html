I don’t really date,” the “Waiting on the World to Change” musician, 45, said during the Wednesday, December 21, episode of <a href=#>the “Call Her Daddy” podcast</a>. “I don’t think that I have to, to be quite honest. I quit drinking like six years ago, so I don’t have the liquid courage. I just have dry courage.”</p><p>The Berklee College of Music alum has had several high profile relationships over the years, dating A-listers including <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Love Hewitt</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jessica Simpson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a>.</p><p>Despite having “a couple of nameplates on me, like ‘Lothario,’” Mayer told “Call Her Daddy” host <strong>Alex Cooper</strong> that he <a href=#>wants to get married</a> and “can’t wait” to argue about dry cleaning with his future wife.</p><p>“Every <a href=#>relationship I’ve ever been in</a> was devoted to the idea that this could go the distance,” the songwriter said. “My entire life, today included, if you told me that I could have a <a href=#>great two months with someone but it would end</a> on the first day of the third month, I would not be interested. I’ve always sought potential for a long-term relationship.”</p><p>Although getting sober may have robbed the Dead & Company musician of his “liquid courage” on dates, it’s also taught him a valuable lesson about to <a href=#>how to navigate relationships</a>.</p><p>“You have to be honest. You have to express yourself. You have to be really glaringly honest,” he said. “You have to express your anxieties. You <a href=#>can’t just walk over them by drinking</a>. You have to be like, ‘This is what I’m anxious about.’ And when someone in life accommodates your anxiety, that’s bonding. I don’t think I’m truly connected with someone until I freak out a little bit and they go, ‘It’s OK.’</p><p>Mayer also <a href=#>hinted at his past relationships</a>, noting that he’s never really gotten to the fully comfortable stage with any partner.</p><p>“I haven’t really got to the part of relationship that was the ‘smooth sailing’ part. I have a feeling when I do, I’m gonna have a lot to work on — but I’ll be excited to work on it,” he said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “Slow Dancing in a Burning Room” singer added that he thrives on <a href=#>overcoming obstacles with romantic partners</a>. “Nothing’s hotter to me than conflict resolution,” he explained. “I am horny for conflict resolution.”</p><p>Scroll through for the biggest revelations from Mayer’s “Call Her Daddy” interview.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt7C0zWakmrGVp3qkrculZKGdomKxorDDsmSrnaaauaLAyKilrGWUlsGqusZmo6KelWLCsbDArZxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
