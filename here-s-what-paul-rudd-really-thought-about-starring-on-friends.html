Behind the scenes, things weren't as smooth either, especially during the final episode. He'll always remember the experience given what a force that show was, though his time on the NBC juggernaut wasn't the most memorable of his career.</p><h2 id=rudd-was-a-prop-on-the-show>Rudd&nbsp;Was "A Prop" On The Show</h2><p>Rudd was well aware that the show revolved around the others and not his character. Because of that, he felt like merely a prop in the episodes,&nbsp;“In something like Friends, the show was about them. I was only in it for just a blip.&nbsp;I felt, ‘I’m like a prop on this show. It’s not about Mike Hannigan,” he added. But there’s a very interesting feeling to be a part of something that has that kind of profound impact on pop culture.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Paul Rudd Almost Ran Jennifer Aniston Over</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1.jpeg><p>He didn't feel too useful on-screen and as it turns out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wasn't comfortable behind the scenes either,</a> especially given some encounters with Jennifer Aniston. He recalls an awkward encounter with Jen, "I was on the set for my first episode and Jennifer was on a Segway because she had broken her toe, and everyone was marveling at it. Matt LeBlanc (who played Joey) asked to have a go and immediately knew how to do it.&nbsp;I then asked to try it too. I spun round and rolled it right over Jennifer’s foot!” he admitted. “The producers look of panic was as if to say, ‘Is it too late to fire him? Has his character been established yet?’ I felt awful. Such an inauspicious start.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At How Paul Rudd Got His Big Break</a></span></p><p>Somehow, Rudd managed to make things even worse during the final episode. Aniston was emotional alongside&nbsp;Marta Kauffman - Rudd decided to lighten the mood but his joke ultimately fell flat. "I thought, I’m not supposed to be there. So to break the ice I went over and just went, ‘We did it, huh? What a ride.’ The joke inevitably fell flat,” he revealed.</p><p>Just being a part of the show was great for Paul's resume but ultimately, the experience did not live up to expectations, for both Paul and what the fans might've expected.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt Messed Up His First Words On Friends</a></span></p><p>Sources: Radio Times, Cheat Sheet & Grazia Daily</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKmZpaF6s8HDnWSrnZGhubp506Gmrp%2BYqXqirs6uq2arpJa%2Fs7XNoGSopl2bv6qxzZ2qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
