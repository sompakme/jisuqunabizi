The discussion has been centered around <a href=#>Donald</a>, Melania, <a href=#>Ivanka</a> and even Don Jr. and <a href=#>Eric</a> to a certain extent. But one of the Trump kids you never hear about is young Barron Trump. At ten years of age, this young fellow has been kept away from a lot of the spotlight that’s been on his entire family. With lots of extreme feelings one way or the other (you either love him or you hate him) toward his dad, it’s a lot for a boy of his age to handle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But regardless of what the world thinks about it, Barron is the son of the President of the United States, who also happens to be a multi-billionaire. What is life like when you are the son of such a wealthy person? Furthermore, how do you deal with so much of what is said and done about your family when you’re just ten years old? Fortunately, there’s some information about young Barron and his amazing lifestyle of privilege and now, great responsibility. While sister Ivanka continues to help steer her father’s political ship and brothers Don Jr. and Eric run the operations of the massive Trump empire, what exactly is there for this ten year old boy to keep him busy? Well, here are 15 things that just may shock you about young Barron!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bilingual>15. Bilingual</h2><p>Barron’s ancestry is very European. He gets his German and Scottish ancestry from his father and Slovenian ancestry from his mother. It is reported that Barron speaks both English and Slovene fluently. When he was at the young age of three, his mother Melania stated that he was fluently speaking English and Slovene, as well as French! It’s unknown how much use he gets in the French language, but the fact that the youngest Trump child was such a talented linguist at such a young age speaks volumes! With a huge emphasis on language, his ability to speak multiple languages is probably also very helpful with his studies at his ultra-expensive Manhattan prep school. It also kind of makes you wonder if he and Melania have their own communication about Donald even when he’s in the same room!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-own-floor>14. His Own Floor</h2><p>Some kids have to share a bedroom, while others get their own bedroom. Some kids are even fortunate enough to have their own playroom. Young Barron Trump has always had so much more, being treated almost as an only child, considering the massive age difference between he and his siblings. This young gentleman has his own floor at the amazingly high rent Trump Tower! Apparently, this floor of his own has not only a bedroom, but his own living room as well. Who knows what all this floor has to offer, as the Trump family tries to keep information about Barron and Melania’s private life as private as possible. But it is very clear that he has had no shortage of space and luxuries while at home. Anything he gets at the White House will pale compared to his lavish lifestyle at Trump Tower.</p><h2 id=attends-the-columbia-grammar-and-preparatory-school>13. Attends The Columbia Grammar And Preparatory School</h2><p>Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School has been open longer than the country in which it resides! Open as a school since 1764, it has quite the list of famous alumni, including Herman Melville, the author of Moby Dick! The school pretty much offers the best education money can buy and at the high price of over $37,000 per year, it had better. Donald and Melania are so happy with the school and how adjusted he is to it that moving to Washington D.C. immediately is not an option for young Barron. Who knows what will happen in future school years, but for now, he’s staying put at Columbia where he is doing very well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rubbed-down-with-caviar-after-his-bath>12. Rubbed Down With Caviar After His Bath</h2><p>Melania Trump, mother of young Barron had her own line of skincare products that has now apparently vanished. One particularly interesting product is a caviar moisturizer that she used to rub all over Barron after his bath. It’s unclear if he still has this routine now that he’s nearly 11 years old, but this was the case just a few years ago. This caviar infused moisturizer is no longer available for purchase (or at least that’s how it seems) and honestly seems a little wild. Caviar is after-all considered one of the most expensive culinary treats a person can have. It makes sense too, doesn’t it? I mean, who hasn’t rubbed caviar all over their skin every night after their bath? Regardless, I suppose it’s just the normal nightly activity when you’re the son of a billionaire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=much-like-his-father>11. Much Like His Father</h2><p>According to his mother, Barron is just like his father. She has referred to him as very smart, but also very opinionated. Apparently, Barron knows what he wants, how and when he wants it. He has his own tastes as well. Young Barron loves airplanes, but apparently prefers clean, white sheets on his bed. Melania calls him a mini Donald and I suppose that’s for good reason. Donald has always been an “eye on the prize” kind of person. Even when no one else saw his vision, he saw a clear path and wasn’t afraid to do whatever was necessary to achieve the vision. Barron has these same qualities and with his father by his side and older brothers with the same instincts, he’ll be very successful in his own right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=enjoys-golf>10. Enjoys Golf</h2><p>Golf has long been regarded as the sport of gentlemen. Many far reaching decisions with a great impact upon the world have been made on a golf course. We all know that Donald is an avid golfer and owns several golf courses of his own. Barron also enjoys the sport and is reportedly pretty good. Donald has indicated that Barron is a natural athlete and quite good at tennis as well as baseball. He spends a fair amount of time golfing with his father and has been photographed many times playing. With an entire floor of his own in Trump Tower, it’s pretty safe to say that there is plenty of room for Barron to work on his short game. He ought to be pretty good, as he’s been playing since he was just three!</p><h2 id=wears-a-suit-every-day>9. Wears A Suit Every Day</h2><p>Barron’s mother has made it clear that he isn’t a “sweatpants kid.” To the other end of that spectrum though, Barron prefers to wear a suit everyday, portraying a kind of Richie Rich vibe to his personality. The uniform at his school, Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School is pretty strict and I suppose Barron has gotten used to his wardrobe to a point where it is just more comfortable. It is also evident that he is a very manicured young man and always looks stylish and clean cut. When you’re the youngest son of the most well known billionaire on the planet and newly elected President of the United States, wearing a suit each day is pretty natural. It also doesn’t help that his mother, a former supermodel wouldn’t be caught dead putting him in sweats.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=unimpressed>8. Unimpressed</h2><p>Barron is growing up, and it seems that he’s a little too cool for all the political hype surrounding his father. He is after all, the youngest child (and presumably the last) of a man that is a constant focus of attention. His life has always been something a little different than everyone else’s. He has been seen and photographed yawning during big speeches by his father and even reportedly rolling his eyes once or twice (we can probably give him the benefit of the doubt on that one). Barron has also been noticeably absent from several major political events for his father. For a kid that wants to be just like his father, you’d think this would be right up his alley. Maybe the political life just doesn’t interest him much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=enjoys-playing-alone>7. Enjoys Playing Alone</h2><p>With much older brothers and sisters, Barron is pretty much being raised like an only child. He has friends and plays with others, but honestly likes playing alone just as much. In typical Trump fashion, he enjoys building structures with his Lego blocks. Maybe he will be as much of a real estate mogul as his father. We already know that he is reportedly more like his father than any of his other brothers and sisters. Barron is perfectly content to play alone in his luxury floor in Trump Tower. He’s also very detail oriented and was even allowed to color and draw on the walls of his rooms. Melania and Donald are happy to let him be creative and express himself, but truthfully, he is very structured and regimented.</p><h2 id=looks-much-older>6. Looks Much Older</h2><p>Barron is only ten years old, but looks much older than his age. Part of this is because of his height. He is pretty tall and arguably one of the tallest kids in his age group at school. Another reason that Barron looks so much older than his age is likely the way he dresses and keeps himself. Notice that his hair is never messy and always combed in a particular style that is usually worn by much older boys and men. Barron’s wardrobe, as discussed before is also not typical for a ten year old boy. When he rocks the suit, with his flawless skin and combed hair, it is hard not to look at Barron and think of him as a teenager. As he does actually age, we can all look forward to seeing how he handles adolescence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=first-boy-in-the-white-house-in-over-50-years>5. First Boy In The White House In Over 50 Years!</h2><p>It’s hard to believe, but any kid living in the White House since the Kennedy administration has been a girl! Not since John F. Kennedy Jr., has a boy called the White House home. Barron is the first since then, but it’s still unclear what his residency will look like. Living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue will be something of a step down for Barron, who will likely have less space available to him. We see that he’s not that interested in all the political pomp and circumstance surrounding his father’s new job, so like a typical ten year old, he may be a little bummed about leaving Trump Tower. It’s doubtful that we’ll see any pictures of him playing in the Oval while his dad works as we did with JFK Jr.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-a-big-hit-in-japan>4. He’s a Big Hit in Japan</h2><p>Apparently, folks in Japan think Barron is both adorable and worthy of fame all on his own. Not long after Donald was elected President, Japanese manga artists began creating a characterization of young Barron. Manga is a form of Japanese comic book art that is wildly popular both in Japan and in many places in the world. This fascination with Barron has essentially made him something of a celebrity in Japan. Whether Barron is aware of this fact or not is unknown, but I would imagine it’s a pretty cool addition to his young ten year old ego (how many pre-teens get to say they are a comic book sensation?). None of Japan’s fascination with Barron would indicate an approval of his father, but that is a whole other story.</p><h2 id=he-s-expensive-to-protect>3. He’s Expensive To Protect</h2><p>It is reported that the cost of protecting Barron and others in the family living in New York will run about a million dollars a day! The accounting on this isn’t itemized and it’s not really clear if that’s just for Barron and Melania, or if it includes the cost of protecting the President himself as well. But considering that for the time being, Barron will continue to live at the top of Trump Tower in the middle of downtown Manhattan, makes it even more difficult to protect him. The costs associated with this are even higher than if he was in the White House. Rumors have circulated about how this protection will work, but it’s pretty safe to say that it’s no easy task, even for the Secret Service.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bashed-on-twitter>2. Bashed On Twitter</h2><p>Regardless of how his dad handles himself on Twitter, young Barron has not done anything to deserve a social media punch. Unfortunately, he has already started off as the butt of a joke by a Saturday Night Live writer. In a move that was really below the belt, SNL writer Katie Rich Tweeted a joke that was considered in poor taste. Saturday Night Live has pulled no punches against Donald Trump, but they responded immediately by indefinitely suspending Rich from the show. She deleted the Tweet and has even issued an apology. First kids are generally given a pass by most out of respect. Usually, the younger they are, the more of a pass they get. It seems as though even SNL respects this long standing tradition and acted accordingly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-hand-holding>1. No Hand Holding</h2><p>Barron is not a little boy anymore. He’s nearly 11 years old and his adolescent rebellion may be starting to show just a bit. It has got to be rough having to start out this process with everyone watching you, but this is the path his father has chosen. In the inaugural parade, Donald, Melania and Barron were walking in the parade when quite obviously when Melania reaches to hold Barron’s hand, he quickly snatches it away. This isn’t really unlike behavior any pre-teen boy may show toward his mother, but the difference is that millions of people watched it, making it somewhat more noticeable. The only thing this really shows us is that Barron is a normal boy that doesn’t feel the need to hold his mommy’s hand anymore. Nothing wrong with that, Barron!</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;ABC News, World Lifestyle, Inquisitr, Newsday, The Sun</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmptXam1qrrGrGSyp6Visaqwza1kpKafrHqirs6uq2aakae%2FsLqMramupaCoeqO1y6WgqKaRnr%2Bmecqim2akmZuytMDYpZxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
