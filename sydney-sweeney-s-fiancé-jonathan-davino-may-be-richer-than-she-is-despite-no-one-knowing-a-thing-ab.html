Over the last few years, Sydney Sweeney has become the latest actor to receive that moniker.For proof that everyone seems to be talking about Sweeney, all anyone has to do is look at the fact that <a href=#>Sydney's nice gesture to her family got people talking about her political leanings</a>. On top of that, there has been a lot of discussion about <a href=#>how Sweeney feels about filming so many intimate scenes</a>.Unsurprisingly, many of Sweeney's fans have also spent time talking about her love life over the years. Unfortunately for anyone who thinks that Sweeney shares an incredible amount of chemistry with her Euphoria co-star Jacob Elordi, <a href=#>the truth about their relationship</a> is they have never dated.Instead of Sweeney getting involved with Elordi, she has reportedly gotten engaged to a man named Jonathan Davino. Since most of Sweeney's fans know next to nothing about Davino, they have no idea he has led an interesting life, and he is far more wealthy than a lot of people may have assumed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-sydney-sweeney-s-net-worth>What Is Sydney Sweeney's Net Worth?</h2><p>Since most people love movies and TV shows, it may seem like the average fan would have a pretty good idea of how making money as an actor works. In reality, however, most people have a lot of misperceptions about how famous actors cash in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sydney-sweeney-looking-unsure.jpg><p>One of the biggest misconceptions that a lot of people seem to have about how Hollywood works is they believe an actor's salary is directly connected to how famous they are. While, that certainly plays a role in how much money an actor gets paid, other factors are much more important.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In reality, movie studios and television networks don't really care that much about how famous an actor is. Instead, they are interested in how much money an actor's past movies have brought in at the box office and how well an actor's past shows performed in the ratings.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Sydney Sweeney's Increased Fame Delay Filming Euphoria Season 3?</a></span></p><p>Even after Sydney Sweeney became internationally famous, she didn't immediately start landing a lot of huge roles. Instead, for a while Sweeney's only high-profile role was starring in the controversial HBO show Euphoria.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, two seasons of Euphoria have aired and there were a lot of headlines about the production of the show's third season being delayed in recent months. Even though so few episodes of Euphoria have been produced, the show has obviously been very financially rewarding for Sweeney.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney Feels Like Her Family And Fans Don't "Understand" Her, Here's Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A couple of years after Euphoria premiered and became a sensation, Sweeney went on to land a leading role in another show that became extremely popular, the first season of The White Lotus.</p><p>In 2023, Sweeney's career is set to hit another high as she is making the leap to the big screen in a major comic book movie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sydney-sweeney-and-dakota-johnson-filming-madame-web.jpg><p>Similar to the Venom movies and Morbius, Madame Web is a part of Sony's slate of Marvel movies based on Spider-Man characters. While Dakota Johnson is set to play the titular Madame Web in the movie, Sweeney also stars in the movie as Julia Carpenter, a character whose superhero alias is Spider-Woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Sweeney has already filmed her Madame Web role, she has already cashed in on becoming a movie star. Thanks to that fact and Sweeney's television roles, she currently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has a $5 million fortune</a> according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><h2 id=what-is-jonathan-davino-s-net-worth>What Is Jonathan Davino's Net Worth?</h2><p>Most of the time when a celebrity starts dating someone new, everyone instinctively things they are involved with a fellow star. However, every once in a while, celebrities get involved with fans or people that the masses have never heard of.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sydney-sweeney-and-jonathan-davino-s-paparazzi-photo.jpg><p>Since Sydney Sweeney rose to fame, she has only been romantically linked to one other person, Jonathan Davino. Aside from the fact that he has been involved with Sweeney, most people have absolutely no idea who Davino is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to reports, Sweeney and Davino's relationship began in 2018. After a couple of years of dating, People put out a report claiming that they'd confirmed that Davino and Sweeney had gotten engaged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sydney-sweeney-s-life-changed-drastically-since-meeting-fiance-jonathan-davino.jpg><p>Once it became clear that there were plans for Sweeney and Davino to walk down the aisle, there was more interest in who Jonathan is. Despite the people who are curious about Davino, the couple keeps things so close to their chest that not much is known about him. As a result, that makes all <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the tidbits of information that is known about Davino</a> all the more interesting.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney’s Life Changed Drastically After Meeting Fiance, Jonathan Davino</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First off, one of the most interesting facts about Davino is that he is thirteen years older than his bride-to-be. On top of that, based on what Sweeney told Cosmopolitan, the reason why her relationship with Davino works is she enjoys spending a lot of time with him.</p><p>“I look for a best friend. I need to be able to be with someone who I can literally hang out with 24/7 and never get sick of and we laugh every single day.”</p><p>Putting aside Sweeney and Davino's relationship, it also is known that he is a restaurateur from Chicago. In fact, according to reports, Davino and his family own a few restaurants in the famous city including one that is known for Italian food named Pompei.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Davino isn't a star the way that Sweeney is, more reputable publications like Forbes and Celebrity Net Worth haven't reported on his fortune. However, according to the website Hollywood North, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Davino has a $3 million fortune</a> as of this writing.</p><p>Considering the source of that claim, that figure has to be taken with a big grain of salt. That said, it does give an idea of the kind of money that Davino is likely to be worth. Still, it is possible that Davino is worth more than that, and he could even be richer than Sweeney. Of course, based on the available information, that seems unlikely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqspyemsZuv9aenKedqah6p7XAp5qeZZqku6LAx5qlZpyRq7avu4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
