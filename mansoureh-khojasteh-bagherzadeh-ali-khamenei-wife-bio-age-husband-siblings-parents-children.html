She was born in a religious family in Mashhad. Her father was Mohammad Esmaeil Khojaste Bagherzadeh, a famous businessman in Mashhad. She is also the sister of Hassan Khojaste Bagherzadeh, former deputy director of IRIB.</strong></p><p>She first met Ali Khamenei in a private ceremony in 1964. They were married in the following year. Their marriage sermon was read by Ayatollah Mohammad Hadi Milani. Mansoureh Khojasteh Bagherzadeh’s husband is Iran’s head of state, commander in chief, and top ideologue. She has been married to her husband for decades and together is the proud parents of six children.</p><p>Her husband was born Ali Khamenei on July 16, 1939, in the holy city of Mashhad, in the province of Khorasan. His father was a religious scholar of modest means, and Khamenei, the second of eight children, followed his father’s path to seminary. (Two of his brothers are also clerics.) He studied in Qom from 1958 to 1964, and while there, he joined the religious opposition movement of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1962. He played an important role in the 1979 Iranian Revolution and went on to become Iran’s president, from 1981 to 1989, and then Khomeini’s successor as supreme leader.</p><p>The dominant figure in Iranian politics is not the president but rather the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Iranian constitution endows the supreme leader with tremendous authority over all major state institutions, and Khamenei has held the post since 1989. He is the second-longest serving head of state in the Middle East. He was previously the president of Iran from 1981 to 1989.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mansoureh-khojasteh-age></span><span>Mansoureh Khojasteh Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She was born on 14 March 1947, Mashhad, Iran.
