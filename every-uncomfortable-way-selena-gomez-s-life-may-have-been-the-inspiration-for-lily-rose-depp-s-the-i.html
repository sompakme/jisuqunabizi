Of course, Tesfaye also co-stars in the series as Tedros, a club owner and cult leader who attempts to control superstar Jocelyn's career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selena Gomez dated Abel Tesfaye in 2016 for 10 months before their breakup in 2017. According to The Daily Mail, the fact that the show not only featured parallels to her own life but also was created by her ex-boyfriend is really what "creeped" her out. And fans seem to agree as various posts on TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram seem to draw multiple connections between the two. This goes far beyond the fact that both the main character on The Idol and Gomez are pop stars, or that they both dated Tesfaye (Tedros in the show).</p><h2 id=did-abel-tesfaye-base-jocelyn-in-the-idol-on-selena-gomez><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Did Abel Tesfaye Base Jocelyn In The Idol On Selena Gomez?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-2-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Abel Tesfaye, AKA The Weeknd, has made no comment on whether or not he based Jocelyn on his ex-girlfriend, Selena Gomez. Although he has used his past relationship with Gomez in the past. Most notably in the lyrics of his song "Call Out my Name" which featured the line, "Guess I was just another pit stop / 'Til you made up your mind / You just wasted my time."</p><p>According to The Daily Mail, Tesfaye may have felt slighted after Gomez ended things with him only to strike up a rekindled romance with her on-and-off-again flame, Justin Bieber. So, while he has not confirmed this, it's not entirely out of the question.</p><p>Additionally, according to Daily Dot, at a Cannes Film Festival press congress, Tesfaye did admit that he drew inspiration from various pop stars he'd encountered in the music business. But co-creator Sam Levinson added that the show wasn't supposed to be an homage to any one particular artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-selena-gomez-comment-on-her-connection-to-the-idol><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Did Selena Gomez Comment On Her Connection To The Idol?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/selena-gomez-as-mabel-mora-in-only-murders-in-the-building-on-hulu.jpg><p>At the time of this writing, Selena Gomez has not officially commented on her alleged connection to her ex-boyfriend's show, The Idol. However, a source reportedly close to her told The Daily Mail that she and her team are taken aback by the whole thing.</p><p>"The similarities between Selena's life and Jocelyn's life are just uncanny," The source told The Daily Mail. "Being [that] she actually dated The Weeknd, it is even more creepy for her. Her real-life pain was used for entertainment value and that really irks her out. Everyone in her team who has known her for a very long time is dumbfounded by this, but at the end of the day Selena is going to do what she always does – rise above and move on."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-and-jocelyn-are-both-child-actors-turned-pop-stars><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Selena Gomez And Jocelyn Are Both Child Actors Turned Pop Stars</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/selena-gomez-felt-ashamed-looking-back-at-how-she-handled-her-wizards-of-waverly-place-co-stars.jpg><p>In The Idol it's revealed that Lily-Rose Depp's Jocelyn began her career as a child star on a hit kid's TV series. If this sounds familiar it's because Selena Gomez also began her career this way working for Disney Channel's The Wizards of Waverly Place.</p><p>As she grew up, Gomez launched a pop music career that was notably more sultry and scandalous than her Disney Channel image. Most notably with the music video for "Good For You" which both looked and sounded like something Jocelyn would have done.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Jake T.

This sparks her season-long attempt at staging a comeback. And she does this by taking scandalous images in lingerie and the hospital bracelet from her time seeking help.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is eerily similar to Selena Gomez's own comeback following her hospitalization. In her music video for "Bad Liar", Gomez can be seen in bed in a skin-tight nightgown rocking her own hospital bracelet.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> According to Buzzfeed</a>, Gomez's music video was also criticized for featuring moaning noises which parallel the sexed-up image that Jocelyn adopts to recapture her fan's attention. Not to mention how one of Jocelyn's songs actually features these sounds.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-39-s-complicated-relationship-with-her-mom-mirror-39-s-jocelyn-39-s><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Selena Gomez's Complicated Relationship With Her Mom Mirror's Jocelyn's</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/has-selena-gomez-s-mom-liked-any-of-the-star-s-confirmed-and-alleged-ex-boyfriends_.jpg><p>Without a doubt, Jocelyn's relationship with her dead mother is the linchpin to a lot of the drama in the series. It was also incredibly tumultuous. One can't say the same for Gomez's relationship with her mother, Mandy Teefy. However, according to Us Weekly, the pair have gone through ups and downs in their relationship. This includes the revelation that Gomez blamed her mother for divorcing her father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Selena Gomez’s Mom Mandy Teefey's Secret Health Issues Caused Her To Gain Weight And Change Her Life Forever</a></span></p><p>Gomez eventually felt bad for being so tough on her mother, particularly because Teefy was extremely supportive of her career early on. However, their relationship was further tested due to her dating Justin Bieber. Like many of Gomez's fans, Teefy had "trust issues" with Bieber as his rocky relationship with her daughter progressed. But as Gomez's mental and physical health were tested, including her diagnosis of Lupus, Teefy was there to support her daughter in every way she could.</p><h2 id=why-selena-gomez-canceled-her-tour><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Selena Gomez Canceled Her Tour</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/389F0A60-7821-47A7-8863-2F7C050F4918.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the first episode of The Idol, viewers learn that Lily Rose-Depp's Jocelyn canceled her recent tour due to suffering the loss of her mother. In 2016, Selena Gomez canceled her own Revivals tour in order to deal with the fallout of being diagnosed with Lupus. According to People, she cited "anxiety, panic attacks, and depression" as the reason why she had to cancel the highly-anticipated tour.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Johnny Depp Reportedly Thinks Of His Daughter's Provocative Role In HBO's New Series, The Idol</a></span></p><p>“I want to be proactive and focus on maintaining my health and happiness and have decided that the best way forward is to take some time off," Gomez said to People in 2016. "Thank you to all my fans for your support. You know how special you are to me, but I need to face this head-on to ensure I am doing everything possible to be my best.
