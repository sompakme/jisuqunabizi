The 29-year-old actress walked the runway for Chanel during Haute Couture Week in Paris on Tuesday, January 23.
Qualley looked demure in a white monochromatic look. The ensemble featured a structured white jacket with buttons down the front and a ruffled collar, a miniskirt, matching tights and black strappy heels.
Her hair was tied back from her face with a simple black bow."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She also appeared in the French fashion house’s 2021 haute couture show. There, she wore an elegant wedding gown featuring long puff sleeves that cinched in at the waist. She carried a pink and purple bouquet and smiled at the audience through a short, thin veil.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>In an interview </a>with Harper’s Bazaar in September 2023, Qualley opened up about the special moment. “I was really happy. It was a really special opportunity for me. I really loved doing it,” she told the publication. “Also, <a href=#>I had just fallen in love</a> and I felt like it was good timing, like a good omen to be a Chanel bride — and it was, it turns out. I remember feeling shocked at how emotional I felt.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Margaret-Qualley-Makes-Her-Runway-Debut-1.jpg><p>Two years after her runway debut, in August 2023, Qualley <a href=#>walked down the aisle</a> in another Chanel wedding dress — this time, her own — to marry music producer <strong>Jack Antonoff</strong>.</p><p>Her real wedding dress featured a halter neck which tied into a neat bow at the back. She paired the understated gown with white Chanel flats and wore her curly hair in a bob.</p><p>Qualley’s decision to wear a Chanel wedding gown on her big day comes as no real surprise. In addition to her runway debut in 2021, the Maid actress has also served as a Chanel ambassador since January 2023, and has appeared in several of their campaigns ever since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Kus7PAq5ytZaGqrq24xLJkoaGkqHq1tMRmmqGZnpq5br7Up66asV2WwW68wKugrGWWlsCptc6nZLCdlaB8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
