Barker was subsequently booked by local police officers upon his return home and was placed on a 12-hour hold for domestic violence. He was released on a $10,000 bond later that evening.</p><p class=p3>“I am humbled beyond words by the support I have received from friends, supporters, and so many in the Alabama family,” the&nbsp;<i>Jay Barker Show&nbsp;</i>host wrote via his radio show’s Instagram upon his release. “We all confront challenges in life, and my family and I are facing one now. Unfortunately, headlines and quick-to-publish news stories do not adequately capture the full context and complex fabric of our lives. I love my family dearly, and at this difficult time, I respectfully ask for privacy for the sake of my family and especially for our kids.”</p><p class=p3>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Dancing With the Stars&nbsp;</i>alum</a> and Barker — who shares four children with ex-wife <strong>Amy DiGiovanna</strong> — separated in April 2021 before the “Born to Fly” singer <a href=#>filed for divorce that August</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sara-Evans-Estranged-Husband-Jay-Barker-Put-on-Probation-After-Allegedly-Trying-to-Hit-Her-With-Car-3.jpg><p class=p3>Evans, for her part, has yet to publicly address Barker’s arrest or ongoing divorce proceedings.

Where we live feels like a small town. People are so friendly here. I have four or five girlfriends who are really close. Our kids all play sports, our families get together and have fun. People think I’m always touring but I’m usually here. I used to take my kids with me on tours — now that they’re older, I can’t do that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly </i>has reached out to Evans and Barker for comment, who did not immediately respond.</p><p class=p3><i>If you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the&nbsp;<a href=#>National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>&nbsp;at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaKWeqbCwKeqZp2oYreixYybmKujlad6sLqMqamompGptrC6jJqdrZ2iYq6tuMSgnJ1lk5a%2FbrXNnKCdnZ6pfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
