He was removed from his mother and raised in foster care. Cam described his American Idol tryout as “rough” before performing Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah and playing the sounds on a piano. He went on to say:</p><p>“We spent a long time in foster care.” I did move when I was 18 and brought my sibling and sister with me. I realized I needed to educate them properly and see them through high school.”</p><p>Amen has been raising his brothers by himself for the past five years. During Cam’s tryout, judge Luke Bryan couldn’t stop crying. Bryan received rousing applause from the three judges and also stated,</p><p>“You’ve been through a lot, but the rest of your life is waiting for you, you hear me?”</p><p>Cam, actual name Cameron Osterloh, works as a waiter at City Fire in Florida and has a canine called Karma.

In another interview, he discussed his American Idol tryout, saying,</p><p>“I’ve worked so hard over the years just to get myself to sing in front of people, so to know I’m on television singing in front of millions is incredible.”</p><p>On his Tik-Tok account, he plays many original tracks as well as some versions, including I Will Always Love You, Lay Me Down, and It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday.
