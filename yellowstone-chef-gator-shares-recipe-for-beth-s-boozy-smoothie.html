Shortly after Guilbeau’s arrival in Montana, Sheridan asked him when he planned to fire up his barbecue pit. “I was thinking about lighting it right now,” Guilbeau recalled saying in a January interview with <a href=#>Delish</a>. In response, Sheridan deadpanned: “That’s the right answer. You’ll do just fine here.”</p><p>Guilbeau — who also goes by Gator in real life — is gearing up for the release of his first cookbook, <a href=#>Yellowstone: The Official Dutton Ranch Family Cookbook</a>, which is available for preorder now and will be available in stores on Tuesday, September 12. The book features recipes themed around beloved characters including Beth (<a href=#><strong>Kelly Reilly</strong></a>) and Rip (<a href=#><strong>Cole Hauser</strong></a>), plus dishes that would fit right in among the ranch hands at any bunkhouse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yellowstone-Chef-Gabriel-Gator-Guilbeau-Shares-Recipe-for-Beth-Dutton-s-Boozy-Smoothie-inline.jpg><p>Keep scrolling for Us Weekly‘s exclusive sneak peek of the recipe for one of Beth’s favorite beverages:</p><h3>Beth’s “Two Scoops of Ice Cream, Three Shots of Vodka” Smoothie</h3><p>Makes 1 smoothie</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><p>2 large scoops vanilla ice cream<br>3 shots vodka (3 oz)<br>1/4 cup fresh orange juice<br>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>Dollop of whipped cream<br>1 slice orange<br>1 Maraschino cherry</p><p><strong>Instructions</strong></p><p>1.
