As a result, they've perfected the art of keeping things so secret, that the public doesn't even know they're married until weeks, or even months after, when they choose to share their news with the world.</p><h2 id=mila-kunis-amp-ashton-kutcher><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mila Kunis & Ashton Kutcher</span></h2><p>When <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis</a>&nbsp;got engaged, they kept the world on their toes when they would get married. In fact, they came up with a plan to throw the public off completely, and it worked! In January of 2015, they had people talking about them secretly getting married when Ashton posted a picture for the holidays, signing it "the Kutchers." They kept the charade up for quite a few months, dancing around the subject of whether or not they got married. Little did the public know, they weren't married after all. Instead, they officially tied the knot a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">few months later in July</a>. They worked hard to keep the secret, notifying guests just 24 hours before where the wedding was taking place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kerry-washington-amp-nnamdi-asomugha><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kerry Washington & Nnamdi Asomugha</span></h2><p>We all know how hard <a href=#>Kerry Washington</a> works to keep her private life private, which is why it's not surprising that she fought hard to keep her marriage and wedding day under wraps. Kerry married her fiance, NFL player Nnamdi Asomugha on June 24, 2013, and the world only found out when the media <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dug up their marriage certificate</a>. The couple kept everything pretty low-key, and not going over the top at all with some lavish wedding. They got married in Hailey, Idaho. Kerry's parents were the witnesses while Nnamdi's sister, Chisaraokwu Asomgha officiated the wedding as she is a minister.</p><h2 id=kristen-bell-amp-dax-shepard><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kristen Bell & Dax Shepard</span></h2><p><a href=#>Kristen Bell and Dax Shephard</a> are arguably one of our favorite couples to date. They were able to keep their marriage under wraps and their wedding day a secret by keeping everything extremely simple. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">For three years</a> they managed to keep their super-secret ceremony hush-hush.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>These Are The Longest-Lasting Celebrity Marriages</a></span></p><p>Eventually, they revealed&nbsp;photos that showed the two of them getting married in a courthouse. In October 2013 the two tied the knot in a Beverly Hills courthouse. The best part? The whole wedding cost $142 — including gas! Kristen calls it the world's worst wedding, even though she wouldn't change anything for the world.</p><h2 id=margot-robbie-amp-tom-ackerley><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Margot Robbie & Tom Ackerley</span></h2><p>In 2016, <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> married her long-time boyfriend Tom Ackerley and a very top-secret wedding ceremony. The two got married in Australia that was in a top-secret location. They managed to keep things so under wraps that there <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aren't many details about the ceremony</a> to this day. There were only about 50 guests that were in attendance, and Margot wore an off-the-shoulder wedding dress with a lot of lace. Margot and Tom definitely did a good job keeping their big day out of the spotlight, that's for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cardi-b-amp-offset><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cardi B & Offset</span></h2><p><a href=#>Cardi B and Offset</a> were one celebrity couple who really managed to keep their wedding a secret from the public. The two were married in September of 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. The wedding was a spur of the moment thing as Offset simply woke up one morning and asked Cardi to marry him. They found someone who would come to their house to marry them, and as a result, the two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had their ceremony in their bedroom</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here Are The 18 Shortest Celebrity Marriages Ever</a></span></p><p>Cardi didn't have any makeup on, nor did she have a ring or even a wedding dress. There was only one guest at the ceremony — Cardi's cousin — who was there to serve as a witness. Even though they had officially gotten married, Offset still officially proposed to Cardi a month later with an outrageously large ring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-lively-amp-ryan-reynolds><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Blake Lively & Ryan Reynolds</span></h2><p><a href=#>Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively</a> are one of Hollywood's favorite couples. Because of their popularity, the two wanted to make sure that they were able to have the wedding of their dreams without the media and the public ruining it. They got married on the grounds of Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina with only 70 guests. There were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no phones allowed during the ceremony</a> to ensure that nothing was leaked and that they were able to celebrate their day on their own terms.</p><h2 id=leighton-meester-amp-adam-brody><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Leighton Meester & Adam Brody</span></h2><p>In 2014, <a href=#>Leighton Meester and Adam Brody</a> surprised fans when they announced that the two had gotten married in a secret wedding ceremony. Fans were particularly surprised to find out that they had tied the knot, as the two have been a pretty <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top-secret couple from the very beginning</a>. They never actually confirmed that they were officially dating, nor did they confirm that they had ever gotten engaged. Their secretiveness definitely paid off as they were able to shock&nbsp;the world with the wedding nuptials.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cameron-diaz-amp-benji-madden><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Cameron Diaz & Benji Madden</span></h2><p>Fans were originally shocked when they found out that <a href=#>Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden</a> were even together, as the two seem like a very unlikely couple in general. In 2015 the two tied the knot in a very secret ceremony. Opting to not have an over the top ceremony, the two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got married in their huge Beverly Hills mansion</a> just a few days before Christmas. The ceremony was held in the backyard, and they had just over 100 guests in attendance to witness them tie the knot.</p><h2 id=ed-sheeran-amp-cherry-seaborn><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ed Sheeran & Cherry Seaborn</span></h2><p><a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a> is definitely one to drop a surprise time and time again. In July of 2019, fans were shocked to find out that he had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">secretly wed his longtime love</a> Cherry Seaborn. The ceremony was so secret that the two had gotten married a few months before they made the big announcement, as they actually had the ceremony in December of 2018. The wedding was very low-key, and even though we thought it would be filled with Ed's celebrity friends, there were only about 40 people, most of them their longtime friends and family members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=niecy-nash-amp-jessica-betts><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Niecy Nash & Jessica Betts</span></h2><p><a href=#>Niecy Nash</a> surprised the world when she took to social media to announce that she's now a married woman.
