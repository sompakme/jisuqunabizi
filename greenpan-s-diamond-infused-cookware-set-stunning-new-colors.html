Having <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">high-quality cookware</a> is so, so important when it comes to cooking with finesse and delivering delicious delicacies — on the first attempt!</p><p>Cheap cookware could be awful at distributing heat, it could not be safe enough for high temperatures, it could literally chip off into your food and it could even contain toxic materials. And how much of a pain is it when it’s not dishwasher-safe? Some of it is just not cute either. We want something we’re actually proud to have in our kitchen — like this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GreenPan Reserve cookware set</a>!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GreenPan Reserve Healthy Ceramic Nonstick Cookware Pots and Pans Set, 10 Piece</a> (originally $400) now starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$350</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, January 17, 2022, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>This set, which now comes in seven gorgeous colors, is one of Amazon’s fastest-rising cookware sets. First, let’s go over what’s included: an 8” frypan, a 11” frypan, a 2QT saucepan with lid, a 3QT saucepan with lid, a 2.5QT skillet with lid and a 5QT stockpot with lid. Each pan or pot is oven safe and broiler safe up to a whopping 600 degrees, while the lids are safe up to 425 degrees!</p><p>The bodies of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these pots and pans</a> are made with duoforged hard anodized aluminum, not only for extra durability and scratch-resistance, but to help evenly distribute heat as you cook. Meanwhile, the Thermolon ceramic nonstick coating might be even more impressive. It’s literally reinforced with diamonds, and it’s free of PFAS, PFOA, lead, and cadmium. It’s even metal utensil safe!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GreenPan Reserve Healthy Ceramic Nonstick Cookware Pots and Pans Set, 10 Piece</a> (originally $400) now starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$350</a> at Amazon!
