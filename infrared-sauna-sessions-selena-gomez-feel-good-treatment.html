According to Sophie Chiche, founder of Shape House, Gomez, 25, is a regular at the Los Angeles studio where she indulges in 55-minute infrared sessions, and has even brought Swift with her to enjoy the super hot treatment too.
“Selena comes often. She’s been incredibly supportive of us and her community and brought a good amount of people,” Chiche exclusively reveals to Us Weekly, adding that the singer hits up the hot spot whenever she’s in town."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

An infrared bed.</p><p>According to Sophie Chiche, founder of Shape House, Gomez, 25, is a regular at the Los Angeles studio where she indulges in 55-minute infrared sessions, and has even brought Swift with her to enjoy the super hot treatment too.</p><p>“Selena comes often. She’s been incredibly supportive of us and her community and brought a good amount of people,” Chiche exclusively reveals to Us Weekly, adding that the singer hits up the hot spot whenever she’s in town. “She does it exactly like everybody else — she wears the clothes, she watches her things, we serve her the tea she likes and she tends to come with a couple of her friends.”</p><p>The “Wolves” songstress has opened up about her sessions at Shape House.</p><p>“I started going to a place called Shape House … you lay in these beds in a sweatsuit, and they wrap you up and you sweat for 45 minutes and it releases all the toxins of your body and you kind of feel … kind of the equivalent of a sauna, but it gets your heart rate up, and it gets everything flowing in your body,” Gomez told Elle in May 2016. “It’s changed my skin, it’s kind of changed my body as well, so it feels really good. That’s kind of been something that works for me personally.”</p><p>According to Shape House’s site, far infrared heat is able to penetrate the body and heat it up from the inside-out. “This type of long wave infrared energy heats the skin in a different way than traditional saunas,” David Colbert, MD, founder of New York Dermatology Group in New York City, tells Us. “It’s called radiant energy for a reason — it penetrates deep into joints and muscles and gives the skin a radiant glow.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Emma-Roberts.jpg><p>Colbert says that potential pros of infrared sessions are extensive: “The main benefits of infrared light are increased relaxation and sense of well-being,” he explains. “Results include improved circulation, increased sweating and release of toxins, reduction of inflammation.”</p><p>Chiche, who founded Shape House six years ago, points out that it’s the slew of health and feel-good benefits that keep clients, like Gomez, coming back. “You can come in with a headache and it will help you. You can come in with having slept very poorly for the past few weeks and it helps,” Chiche tells Us. “You can come in with pretty much anything the body is struggling with and when you remove toxins from the body, you give your body a chance to heal itself.”</p><p>Other Shape House acolytes include <a href=#><strong>Emma Roberts</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Hannah Simone</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ashley Benson</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Price</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have a card for the Shape House. It’s a place where you can burn 600 calories by just lying there,” Price, who stars in ABC’s Splitting Up Together, tells Us. “[The sauna] is part of a whole <a href=# data-link=1>detox</a> thing I’ve been trying to do.”</p><p>Unlike other well-known infrared sauna facilities (such as HigherDOSE in NYC), Shape House utilizes individual beds, not walk-in rooms, that keep your face out of the heat. The temperature remains at a constant 158 degrees for the entire session and it’s only the last 10 to 15 minutes that you feel the extreme temperature, notes Chiche.</p><p>“At the end your heart will be pounding like you just ran a 10k — your body is now exposed to this heat and it’s heating up, heating up, heating up and your body is saying, ‘No we need to cool down. Let’s cool down.’ It’s fighting the heat and that is how you burn calories — trying to bring your temperature back down,” she explains. And it’s this internal heating up, that Chiche says, helps the body burn anywhere from 500 to 800 calories in a single session.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaippanrrOxw2aqmq2elnq0sdKsoKimo2LAprjEp5hmn5%2Bisrt5xZ6cpWWXpLyledOrnJqsnZq7tXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
