"Best Song Ever" was their highest-charting single. "History" was the last single they released before their indefinite hiatus (and possibly their last single ever). There is another song, however, that is equally important to One Direction, even though it didn't appear on any of their albums or sell millions of copies around the word.</p><p>That song is "Torn", and this is why "Torn" is so important to One Direction.</p><h2 id=quot-torn-quot-was-originally-performed-by-the-band-ednaswap><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>"Torn" Was Originally Performed By The Band Ednaswap</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ednaswap is a rock band that existed for a few years in the mid-1990s. Band members Scott Cutler and Anne Preven wrote the song along with their producer Phil Thornalley. Ednaswap performed "Torn" in 1993, but they did not record it until 1994. And in fact, the song was actually first recorded by another singer in another language.</p><h2 id=and-it-was-originally-performed-by-danish-singer-lis-s-oslash-rensen><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>And It Was Originally Performed By Danish Singer Lis Sørensen</span></h2><p>www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyuGaU4rXjA</p><p>Lis Sørensen is a Danish singer, and therefore, unsurprisingly, she performed "Torn" in Danish. It was called "Brændt", which is the Danish word for "burned". A year later, Ednaswap recorded the song themselves -- in English, of course.</p><h2 id=but-natalie-imbruglia-made-quot-torn-quot-a-hit><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>But Natalie Imbruglia Made "Torn" A Hit</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time Natalie Imbruglia recorded "Torn", it had already been recorded by several other artists. In addition to Lis Sørensen and Ednaswap, the song had also been recorded in 1996 by singer Trine Rein.</p><p>However, while all of those earlier recordings were mildly succesful, it was Natalie Imbruglia who made "Torn" a true hit. Her version has sold over 4 million copies, and it one of the most succesful British singles of all time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Liam Payne Admitted He Is The Closest To This One Direction Star ">Liam Payne Admitted He Is The Closest To This One Direction Star</a></span></p><h2 id=thirteen-years-later-one-direction-performed-quot-torn-quot><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Thirteen Years Later, One Direction Performed "Torn"</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Torn" already had quite the history by the time One Direction performed the song. In addition to Ednaswap, Lis Sørensen, Trine Rein, and Natalie Imbruglia, a Brazilian girl group called Rouge had also recorded a Portuguese version of the song. Because they were performing a song that had already been covered so many times, One Direction surely felt some pressure to make their cover stand out. As we know now, they certainly succeeded.</p><h2 id=quot-torn-quot-was-their-first-song-together-as-a-group><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>"Torn" Was Their First Song Together As A Group</span></h2><p>As most fans certainly know, One Direction was formed on The X Factor. Each of the boys auditioned as individual performers. Liam Payne sang Frank Sinatra's "Cry Me A River", Harry Styles sang Stevie Wonder's "Isn't She Lovely", Louis Tomlinson sang Plain White T's “Hey There Delilah”, Niall Horan sang Ne-Yo's “So Sick”, and Zayn Malik sang Mario's “Let Me Love You”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the boys were put together into a group, the first song they were given to sing together was "Torn". Their performance was strong enough to allow them to advance to the next round. It was also a major hit with fans.</p><h2 id=they-faced-some-adversity-before-their-performance><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Faced Some Adversity Before Their Performance</span></h2><p>www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiu94PLe3rE</p><p>Just hours before One Direction was set to perform "Torn" in front of Simon Cowell, disaster struck. Band member Louis Tomlinson stepped on a sea urchin at the beach and had to be rushed to the hospital. He made it back just in time for the performance, and had to sing while still recovering from his injury.</p><p>Luckily for One Direction - and their future fans - the performance went off without a hitch, and One Direction made it to the next round of The X Factor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Zayn Malik Really Feels About One Direction">How Zayn Malik Really Feels About One Direction</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-they-performed-it-again-during-39-the-x-factor-39-final><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>And They Performed It Again During 'The X Factor' Final</span></h2><p>One Direction made it to the very final episode of TheX Factor, where they faced off against Matt Cardle and Rebecca Ferguson. For their final performance, the boys sang "Torn" – the same song that they sang in their very first performance together. Unfortunately, the performance wasn't enough for One Direction to advance to the final round, and they ultimately finished in third place.</p><h2 id=one-direction-officially-recorded-quot-torn-quot-shortly-before-their-indefinite-hiatus><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>One Direction Officially Recorded "Torn" Shortly Before Their Indefinite Hiatus</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In November 2015, One Direction performed in the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge. They recorded their own song "Infinity" as well as covers of "Torn" and "FourFiveSeconds". This performance was one of the band's very last live performances together before their indefinite hiatus, which began in January 2016. Sadly, <a href=#>Zayn Malik had already left the band</a> before this version of "Torn" was recorded.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="The Career Path Harry Styles Almost Pursued Before One Direction">The Career Path Harry Styles Almost Pursued Before One Direction</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbyzuoybsGamkamurbXEZqCmmqKqtK21wGaqqGWZor2wvtOapa1lpKR6sLrEZpuiqpWYwaq7zWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
