Nico has supported countless independent businesses through his social media campaigns which have earned stores hundreds of followers, and even more important, new customers. During the pandemic, New York Nico <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hit new strides</a> and made efforts to secure funding for mom n pop shops in need. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created revenue streams</a> and highlighted some of New York’s oldest establishments, making sure that nothing, not even a global pandemic, could cause them to shut their doors. Through discovering and sharing some of New York’s most emblematic characters, creating campaigns that serve to benefit the New York community, and through global partnerships that have kept him on everyone’s radar beyond the city limits, New York Nico is hereby dubbed the “official” talent scout of <a href=#>New York</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-cast-of-colorful-characters>A cast of colorful characters</h2><p>New York Nico makes New York City seem like a live-action episode of Sesame Street.

Tiger is known for switching out golf balls for milk cartons and exchanging 18-hole courses with the city streets of SoHo in a sport he dubs “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Golf</a>.” Hood has seen an exponential interest in both his golf and his photographs since New York Nico featured him on his Instagram, even leading to a collaboration between Tiger and Will Smith, who scored one of the highly-coveted “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hole-in-one</a>” shots in the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another subject featured in Nico’s documentaries is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Saviello</a>, Big Mike, of Astor Place Hair Stylists.
