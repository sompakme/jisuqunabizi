Although her professional life has always been front and center, Keshia has had quite a whirlwind when it comes to her personal life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bill Cosby Tried To Get Wendy Williams Fired From Her Radio Show</a></span></p><p>Pulliam was tied into the Bill Cosby case after <a href=#>she expressed her support</a> for the former actor, all while finding herself in a troubled marriage. Considering the success she'd had in the biz, it's no surprise that fans wonder <a href=#>what Keshia Knight Pulliam has been up to</a>, and we're diving into just that!</p><h2 id=child-star-success-story>Child Star Success Story</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1984, Keshia Knight Pulliam scored the role of a lifetime on The Cosby Show playing Rudy Huxtable. This landed the star a series of spin-offs, including A Different World, where she reprised her on-screen role as Rudy over three episodes. It didn't take much time before Pulliam to make a name for herself, and following the end of the series in 1992, she took a break from the limelight before returning in the early 2000s.</p><p>Keshia landed roles in films such as The Gospel, Beauty Shop, Death Toll, and Madea Goes To Jail, to name a few, however, her biggest successes following The Cosby Show came much later in her career. In 2018, Pulliam scored a spot in 3 Year Plan, playing the role of Tracey Tarpley-Spatafora, making it clear TV was always her saving grace. In 2007, Keshia joined the cast of House Of Payne, and has remained on the series since!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-stood-by-bill-cosby>She Stood By Bill Cosby</h2><p>Considering the success she earned from The Cosby Show, it's no surprise that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keshia Knight Pulliam stood by Bill Cosby's side </a>during his 2017 trials for his sexual assault charges. Keshia came under fire by the public for supporting Cosby at the time, however, she made it clear that her support was not a defense.</p><p>Keshia appeared on The Real, where she shared her reasoning behind being a support system to Cosby at the time, telling the panel of hosts that, "you have to understand that in our criminal justice system, you're innocent until proven guilty, and this is a man I've known my entire life, and that was just never my experience with him, so I was happy to be there and see for myself, cause ultimately that's what this country is founded on," Keshia said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Loni Love asked what the two talked about during the trial, and while the two didn't play catch up, Keshia said that she was there simply to show her support. "So you went there to show your support and just to be there?" Loni asked. "That's it!" Keshia said. Flash forward to 2021, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has overturned Bill Cosby's conviction, allowing him to be set free from prison.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Charmaine From 'The Cosby Show' Looks Like Now</a></span></p><h2 id=marriage-motherhood-amp-divorce>Marriage, Motherhood & Divorce</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Keshia married Edgerton Hartwell, former Baltimore Ravens star, however, their marriage was far from picture-perfect. According to Ed Hartwell, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their marriage dissipated</a> only months following their nuptials. The athlete claims that Keshia's focus went straight to having kids, rather than enjoying their time married to one another.</p><p>"She wanted a baby really fast, and from my beliefs, from seeing other successful people — that when you first get married ... we should actually focus on each other and not just have a baby," he shared. When the couple announced their split, Keshia revealed she was pregnant, and Ed immediately asked for a paternity test over uncertainties if the child was his or not.</p><p>Well, turns out that Ed was, in fact, the father. Although the duo remained separated, officially filing for divorce in 2018, the two do co-parent their daughter, Ella Grace. While Ed is involved in the child's life, despite being estranged from Keshia, the former NFL player is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not ready to pay child support.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keshia-found-love-again>Keshia Found Love Again</h2><p>While things didn't work out on her first go, it seems as if Keshia has found love yet again! During her time working on the TV film, Pride & Prejudice: Atlanta, Pulliam met fellow co-star, Brad James, and the two began dating shortly after. Well, turns out their love took a turn for the best, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two are officially married.</a></p><p>Keshia posted a pic of their wedding onto her Instagram, claiming it was the most "perfect" wedding, all while describing James as her "best friend." Although Keshia was firm on having kids during her first marriage, the actress has yet to reveal whether she and Brad intend on having a family of their own, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's How Raven Symone's Wife Helped Her Get Into Shape</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqqv4ycpqyaqWK4qrCMpJysoJmWeqy6yKCfrWWgqrmttcCmZK2nlJbGbsPHnqmeZZGnsm7Ax56wZqafrHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
