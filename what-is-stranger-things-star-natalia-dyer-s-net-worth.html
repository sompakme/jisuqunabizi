While Natalia (AKAA Nancy Wheeler) may not be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth the most of the Stranger Things cast</a>, she has certainly made a lot of money. This isn't surprising as Natalia has been able to snag a few roles outside of <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong>'s</a> hit show, not unlike many of the cast members who've starred in other major projects.

Let's find out...</p><h2 id=250-000-per-episode-helped-build-natalia-39-s-2-million-net-worth>$250,000 Per Episode Helped Build Natalia's $2 Million Net Worth</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Cable.TV</a>, Natalia Dyer makes about $250,000 per episode of Stranger Things, before taxes. Given that she wasn't all-that famous before the first season of the show, he earned less in her first year... This was true of the entire young cast, who were making around $30,000 per episode. They were paid a similar number in Season Two, but come Season Three, they re-negotiated their contracts and pulled close to this whopping $250,000 figure. In all likelihood, this is what Natalia will also be paid for the upcoming fourth season of the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is ‘Stranger Things’ Star Joe Keery’s Girlfriend, Maika Monroe?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It appears as though all of the young main cast members, except for Sadie Sink and Dacre Montgomery, are being paid the same. This is also with the exception of Millie Bobby Brown, who is being paid $350,000 like established stars Winona Ryder and David Harbour.</p><h2 id=natalia-only-had-a-handful-of-roles-before-stranger-things>Natalia Only Had A Handful Of Roles Before Stranger Things</h2><p>Natalia grew up in Nashville, Tennesse, and was encouraged to attend and graduate from a performing arts school there. While she was a quiet and studious child, there was tons of artistic energy dwelling within her. Perhaps because she had an emotional depth from dealing with health hardships at a young age. Natalia missed tons of school due to asthma and would get pneumonia almost every year. On top of this, she struggled with a very frail figure. All of this stopped her from pursuing athletic goals and landed her in drama programs... which she ended up loving.</p><p>This inspired her parents to encourage her to seek work in the entertainment industry, something she was accepted into pretty quickly...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">promoting her work in Yes, God, Yes</a>, Natalia spoke to Access' Scott Evans a little bit about the very first on-screen role she had... in Hannah Montana: The Movie.</p><p>"I had a very small role in it," Natalia explained. "I played this British girl. And I'm sure my accent couldn't have been anything good. But I was. It got me on my first red carpet situation. And I was like 'I can't hate on it, you know?' "</p><p>Even though she may not be proud of her work in Hannah Montana: The Movie, the chance to work in it opened doors for Natalia.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To ‘Hannah Montana’ Star Emily Osment?</a></span></p><p>Soon after, Natalia was cast in a short film called Too Sunny For Santa and then in Teh Greening Of Whiney Brown, starring Brooke Sheilds. Natalia then found herself in a number of independent films such as Blue Like Jazz, I Believe In Unicorns, and Don't Let Me Go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while she pursued her love of film, Natalia did decide to go to University in New York but things changed when she was cast in Stranger Things... A Role that would ultimately change her life...</p><h2 id=natalia-is-focused-on-her-work-and-remains-private>Natalia Is Focused On Her Work And Remains Private</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/joe-keery-natalia-dyer-and-charlie-heaton.jpg><p>While Stranger Things made Natalia Dyer famous, she remains intensely private. While the world always wants to know more about her real-life relationship with her on-screen love-interest (Charlie Heaton), she keeps mum. Natalia was asked about how she navigates fame in a 2019 interview with AM to DM.</p><p>"I'm kind of private as a person. Introverted. So, it has been hard," Natalia admitted. Although she does say that she is flattered when people come up to her and tell her that her work inspired them or that they love Stranger Things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But there is the whole other, you know, the fame aspect is... I don't know if I will ever really get used to it. I'm still navigating it and processing and you have to figure out what works for you, what doesn't. What your boundaries are. Social media is really tricky."</p><p>However, Natalia has earned some cool roles thanks to her fame and exposure due to being on Stranger Things.</p><p>This includes work in Mountain Rest, After Darkness, Tuscaloosa, Netflix's Velvet Buzzsaw with Jake Gyllenhaal, and the upcoming movie Things Heard & Seen.</p><p>With more Stranger Things on the way, as well as many more film roles, there's no sign of Natalia's career slowing or her bank account shrinking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edKtqZqml5q%2FbsDHoqWgq12owaK%2BjKeYrZmcnq5usNieqaxlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
