For some people, this is a difficult decision made after much thought and deliberation.</p><p>For others, it may be something that is done impulsively or without much consideration at all. There are many reasons why people might choose to change their names.&nbsp;</p><p>Some people do it to disassociate themselves from their past or escape a bad reputation. Others may want to start fresh and create a new identity for themselves.</p><p>It’s also possible that a person simply prefers the sound of a different name or wants to change their name to match their gender identity.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it is important to remember that changing your name is not without complications.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is it acceptable to go by multiple names?&nbsp;</h2><p>There are several reasons a person might want to use more than one name. Some people do it because they want to keep their personal and professional lives separate.</p><p>Others do it because they want to change their identity altogether. And finally, some people do it because their parents have given them more than one name.</p><p>Multiple names are often used in everyday life without people even realizing it. For example, many people have both a legal name and a nickname.</p><p>While no specific laws prohibit a person from using more than one name, some laws could potentially be violated if a person uses multiple names for fraudulent purposes.</p><p>For example, if a person uses a different name to avoid paying taxes or to commit bank fraud, they could be charged with a crime.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How can multiple names be beneficial?</h2><p>Many people have more than one name. This is often the case for entertainers who use a stage name or authors who use a pen name.</p><p>There are many reasons why someone might choose to do this. Some people might want to create a separate persona for their professional work, while others might want to hide their true identity for safety reasons.</p><p>In such situations, using a different name in a professional context can be useful.</p><p>There are many famous examples of people who have used multiple names. One of the most well-known is singer and actress <a href=#>Cher</a>, who was born Cherilyn Sarkisian.</p><p>She started using the stage name “Cher” in the early 1960s, and it eventually became her legal name. Another example is author J.K. Rowling, who wrote the Harry Potter series under the pen name “Robert Galbraith.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Changing your name through a deed poll</h2><p>When a woman gets married, she can take her husband’s last name, keep her maiden name, or hyphenate the two. This decision can be made before or after the wedding.</p><p>If a woman chooses to keep her maiden name for professional use but changes her husband’s name for all other purposes, she can do this with a deed poll.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deed poll</a> is a document that allows you to change your name legally. It is important to note that a deed poll does not automatically change your name – it simply allows you to use a new name legally.</p><p>You will still need to go through the process of officially changing your name with all appropriate agencies (e.g., National Insurance Number, passport office, etc.)&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h3><p>Existing under multiple names, is it legal? There is no definitive answer to this question as it can vary from place to place and even country to country. However, it is generally legal to be known by more than one name.</p><p>This is typically only an issue if someone is trying to conceal their identity or try to scam someone. In most cases, people are free to use whatever name they want without fear of legal repercussions.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC10magrWWcmrSiuIytpmagkauybrnUpauiqJyaeq%2BtzJ6qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
