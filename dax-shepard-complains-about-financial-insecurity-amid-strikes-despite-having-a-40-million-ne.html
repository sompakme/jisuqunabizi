However, some have perceived Dax Shepard's recent comments about how the protests are affecting his finances to be tone deaf, considering his net worth.</p><p>During a recent episode of his Armchair Expert podcast, Dax hosted Jason Derulo as a guest and they <a href=#>started discussing how “money fights” can lead to “turmoil”</a> in relationships.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kristen Bell And Dax Shepard Got Kicked Out Of The Boston Airport At 1 AM For One Specific Reason</a></span></p><h2 id=dax-says-his-financial-anxieties-were-caused-by-a-poor-childhood>Dax Says His Financial Anxieties Were Caused By A Poor Childhood</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/depositphotos_268179906_xl.jpg><p>Dax admitted he feel the financial pressure caused by the strikes have infiltrated arguments in his personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I am currently in a, like, two-month spiral of just completely out of hand financial insecurity,” he explained. “This new fear of, ‘I’m gonna somehow be broke or I’m gonna lose everything, podcasting is gonna be over, there’s an actors strike and I’m not gonna act.’ It’s so foundationless, it’s preposterous.”</p><p>But the actor said he recognizes that his fear aren’t wholly based on the present situation. Rather, a lot of it stems from his childhood, when he grew up in financial insecurity. Dax says he’s scared about the same happening again, especially now that he’s a father himself.</p><p>“It’s not related to reality,” he went on. “It’s from growing up poor. I just can’t shake it. So, to your point, you watch your parents fight about money, you think money’s the problem. But money’s not the problem.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dax-and-kristen-are-worth-millions-but-this-could-hurt-their-marriage>Dax And Kristen Are Worth Millions, But This Could Hurt Their Marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screen-shot-2023-08-22-at-1-03-29-pm.png><p>Dax Shepard and his wife Kristen Bell both have serious fortunes to their names.
