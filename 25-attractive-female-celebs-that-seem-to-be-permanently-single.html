We're obsessed with Hollywood relationships. We want to know who is dating whom, and for how long. And just as soon as we hear that two celebs have gone their separate ways, we scour the gossip magazines to see what went wrong. Did <a href=#>Anna Faris</a> divorce <a href=#>Chris Pratt</a> because of how bankable he is as an actor? Or was it something else? Either way we love to know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This listicle is all about&nbsp;gorgeous female celebs who seem permanently single. That's not to say they don't date. It's just that our fave stars&nbsp;take a little too long to dip into the relationship pond in between break ups.&nbsp;But they don't need to date, as we found out.&nbsp;Most times we hear that these singletons are focusing on their careers. Or that they are enjoying their time alone. They&nbsp;don't feel alone while alone. Instead they say something refreshing, that they don't need a man in their lives to feel complete.&nbsp;When they announce they're currently single, they also make sure to add that they are committed to themselves and their own happiness, which is what <a href=#>Adriana Lima</a>&nbsp;said. It's girl power all around, especially when Lima also added&nbsp;that she's married to herself after a split. Even <a href=#>January Jones</a>, whom you would never conceive of her being single since she's so ethereal, said, "I just don’t feel I need a partner. . . I don’t feel unhappy or lonely. It would have to be someone amazing that I would want to make room. Someone who would contribute to my happiness and not take away from it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well put. So here you go. What these women have in common besides being alone is their wish to crush the stigma that being a single (white or black) female is not a bad thing. They are feminists at heart, trying to change the way women are seen around the world.</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie>Angelina Jolie</h2><p><a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> has a lot going on. She's an actor, director,&nbsp;a humanitarian, and a mother to six children. She split from <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> in 2017 and she's single now. We thought Jolie and Pitt were forever, but it seems that leaving&nbsp;him was in their best interest; they lasted twelve years together without exchanging rings, and spent only two years being married.&nbsp; According to her <a href=#>Vanity Fair cover story in 2018</a>, Jolie doesn't conceive of herself as a symbol, so maybe being single and not dating is fine with her right now. But she did <a href=#>add</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I’m being smart about my choices, and I’m putting my family first, and I’m in charge of my life and my health. I think that’s what makes a woman complete.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When she feels pains over the incident, she chooses to hide it from her kids and instead cries in the shower, according to the VF interview.</p><p>But unlike many stars on the list, Jolie doesn't celebrate that she's single. In fact, it's the opposite. <a href=#>As she said</a>, "It's been difficult. I don't enjoy being single. It's not something I wanted. There's nothing nice about it. It's just hard. Sometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it all together, but really I am just trying to get through my days."</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston>Jennifer Aniston</h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=#>Justin Theroux</a>&nbsp;dated for seven years and were married for only two years before announcing their separation in February 2018. <a href=#>According to People</a>, Aniston&nbsp;told the magazine that she is sad and disappointed about the split. She had not anticipated being single and "isn't a fan of dating, and she never was.&nbsp;She always found dating awkward and unpleasant. ”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>And&nbsp;she hates "all the media attention that she knows she will get now. But she is a big believer in falling in love and spending her life with a partner."</strong></p><p>But for now, she's one of the&nbsp;most beautiful actresses who somehow seems to be permanently single. Look at her relationships with Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux. There's a stretch of time between breaking up with those stars.</p><p>Also, Aniston is fed up with the press infiltrating her private life, especially about whether or not being single makes her complete. In a now famous essay, published in 2016 by the <a href=#>Huffington Post</a>, Aniston said:</p><p>“For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. This past month in particular has illuminated for me how much we define a woman’s value based on her marital and maternal status. . . The sheer amount of resources being spent right now by press trying to simply uncover whether or not I am pregnant points to the perpetuation of this notion that women are somehow incomplete, unsuccessful, or unhappy if they’re not married with children."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added, “We don’t need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own 'happily ever after' for ourselves.”</p><h2 id=anna-faris>Anna Faris</h2><p>Anna Faris and Chris Pratt were a power couple in Hollywood before they ended their eight-year marriage in August 2017. Faris successfully bounces back between TV (Mom) and movies (The House Bunny) and Chris Pratt transitioned from TV (Parks & Recreation) to movies (Jurassic Park, Guardians of the Galaxy) and, in the process became a mega-superstar.&nbsp; But their split changed everything. It even led Faris to question marriage in a philosophical way, <a href=#>according to the transcription of Dax Shepard's podcast&nbsp;Armchair Expert</a>. She believes in partnership but not the conventions of marriage, and doesn't understand why it is something you need to aspire to.</p><p><strong>As Faris put it,&nbsp; "I'm a romantic. . . I believe in companionship. I just don't know if I believe in the ceremony of wedding, necessarily."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So we hope for the best while she's single, and perhaps now she'll have the time to focus more on her career.</p><p><a href=#>Faris also spoke further </a>about whether or not she'll ever marry again after two divorces. She was married to actor Ben Indra from 2004 to 2007 and to Chris Pratt from 2009 to 2017. The downtime between each relationship makes her look like she's permanently single. As Faris said,&nbsp; “I need to figure out what the purpose is. . . ,” <a href=#>Faris&nbsp;said in a Page Six transcription </a>derived from <a href=#>Dax Shepard</a>’s“Armchair Expert” podcast. “Is it safety for your children? Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more? For me, I’m just not quite sure where it fits, especially when it feels so easy to get married, and then the untangling — when the state gets involved.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mindy-kaling>Mindy Kaling</h2><p><a href=#>Mindy Kaling</a> seems to be permanently single. That's because she's the <a href=#>busiest person in Hollywood</a>&nbsp;who is beloved by her fans and has <a href=#>3.8 million followers on Twitter</a>. She dated <a href=#>B.J. Novak</a>, who worked with her on the hit comedy The Office. But these days they are just friends. And while she may not have found true love, she is a mother, an accomplished actress, a writer, and an executive producer. Kaling even managed to have time to&nbsp;write two books, both of which were memoirs. Each hit the New York Times bestseller list.</p><p>Kaling feels more comfortable in her professional life than in her personal life. She told <a href=#>American Way</a>:&nbsp;“My professional life is the only thing that I feel I have a lot of control over—romantic stuff is a little bit more mysterious. I think a lot of women respond to that.” So it's girl power all the way! Her take on being single is refreshing and <a href=#>gives her benefits</a>:&nbsp;“In my 20s, I was not only boy crazy, but marriage and relationship crazy. Now it’s almost the opposite. My work is so rewarding and I’m so self-centered about it that I’m kind of excited about not having to go home and ask someone about their day.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-culpo>Olivia Culpo</h2><p>Olivia Culp, the 2012 Miss Universe pageant winner, has officially confirmed her split this past March from former New England Patriots wide receiver, <a href=#>Danny Amendola</a>. The athlete and beauty queen started dating in 2016. Together for two years, Culpo admits that, even after two months or so, it's hard to talk about their relationship.&nbsp;“We are broken up. It’s just so fresh for me. I don’t feel comfortable talking about it,” she said <a href=#>in an interview with Access Hollywoo</a><a href=#>d</a>.</p><p><strong>“Everyone goes through breakups in life," t<a href=#>he 25-year-old model said</a>. "Everybody has their own way of handling it and it’s something that I definitely am not going to get into at this moment. But I am sure everyone can relate to heartbreak.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amendola, who is now a wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, has yet to comment on the break up. The relationship fizzled out due to “distance and them barely seeing each other,” <a href=#>a source told Us</a><i>.&nbsp;</i>“He got signed to the Miami Dolphins and Olivia wasn’t going to move there.” There's also another reason. Amendola, who previously won two Superbowls playing for the New England Patriots,&nbsp;also wasn’t pleased that <a href=#>Culpo posed nude for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue</a>.</p><p>The reason why the breakup is so fresh is because, prior to their breakup, they just came back from vacationing in the Bahamas. This time, it wasn't gossip sources that made the split public. It was his fans, who were quick to notice that Amendola unfollowed the actress on Instagram and even deleted all of their photos together. As for Culpo, she has kept photos of them on her account.</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore>Drew Barrymore</h2><p><a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a> has been single for two years now after leaving her husband Will Kopelman. But unlike other Hollywood break-ups, there's no bad blood.&nbsp;As she revealed in an<a href=#> Instagram post</a>, she credits&nbsp;Kopelman for helping her juggle professional and personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So I say to Will Kopelman thank you for always being the best dad and supporting and enabling me to do what I need and want to do. I know that’s not everyone’s situation. And I never take it for granted. I never had family growing up. And that’s also a support system I cherish every day of my life. I love my family and everyone in it. . . And man, did I pick well!"</p><p>As <a href=#>Livingly Media claimed</a>, now that she has experienced being married and having kids, for the first time she's putting herself first. She's not looking for love right now.&nbsp;She can now&nbsp;embrace&nbsp;all the roles she has in her life without being&nbsp;dragged down by dating or getting married. And she doesn't understand why people want to rush into a relationship because they fear being single, and also because they are alone.&nbsp;As she<a href=#> said</a>, “It's ironic that we rush through being 'single' as if it's some disease or malady to get rid of or overcome. The truth is, most likely, one day you will meet someone and it will be gone. And once it's gone, it's really gone! Why does no one tell us how important it is to enjoy being single and being by yourself? That time is defining and amazing and nothing to sure. It is being alone that will actually set you up the best for being with someone else.” Well put!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence>Jennifer Lawrence</h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> is untouchable. She is an award-winning star and the most popular actress in Hollywood. She shot to fame by starring in the Hunger Games franchise (2012-2015).&nbsp;And she became an A-lister who won the <a href=#>2015 Guinness World Record</a> for highest-grossing action hero because the series was a success and made more than $1.52 billion internationally. Lawrence's fame continued to grow with her performance as a depressed bipolar widow in the film Silver Linings Playbook (2012),&nbsp; which earned her an <a title="Academy Award for Best Actress" href=#>Academy Award for Best Actress</a>. The film is obviously a comedy! And she is a Dior spokesmodel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Lawrence has never had any trouble landing amazing roles--that's what you get when you alone can open up a movie--she has unfortunately not found success in her love life so far. She <a href=#>started dating the famous director Darren Aronofsky in 2016</a>, but the couple broke up a year later. Apparently, Lawrence has a lighter take when it comes to dating. She once joked about not being tethered to anyone: "<a href=#>What dating life</a>?" That attitude is why her break-ups are never tragic to the point where you have to go to a different grocery store because your ex goes to the same one you do. As she told <a href=#>E!</a>:</p><p>"I'm friends with all my exes, actually. For the most part, yeah. . . I have a theory. I think it's because I'm blunt. I don't think that you can have any sort of bad relationship with anybody if you're just blunt. Everybody always knows how you feel at all times and there's no lying, it's just honesty. Everybody's a good guy to each other. All my boyfriends have been wonderful. Nick [Hoult] was a great boyfriend."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-garner>Jennifer Garner</h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a> has been single since splitting from her second husband <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a> in 2015. They divorced (it was finalized in April 2017) due to rumors that Ben was busy with SNL producer Lindsay Shookus, according to the <a href=#>Daily Mail UK</a>. That turned out to be true. But the Mail&nbsp;claims&nbsp;that the estranged couple have&nbsp;remained on good terms and share joint custody of their three children&nbsp;and are also&nbsp;co-parenting them.</p><p>But Unlike Ben, Garner has yet to date anyone after their split. She has been single for more than two years--making her permanently single for a while--and has told&nbsp;<a href=#>news.com.au</a>:</p><p><strong>“I would not have chosen this life for myself or for my kids. I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It’s something that we are working through. I haven’t been on a date and I am not interested in dating. . . People want to set me up and I am just like, ‘No thank you!’”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Um, okay, then. But Garner is still standing behind the Gone Girl actor. She has <a href=#>defended</a> him, especially when news broke that the TV star of One True Hill, Hilarie Burton, claimed he&nbsp;was inappropriate with&nbsp;her years ago on TRL. Garner has this to say: 'We can’t lump all men into [the same category]. We can’t just assume that every man has done something awful or that every man is guilty; due process is important and has to take place.”</p><h2 id=emilia-clarke>Emilia Clarke</h2><p><a href=#>Emilia Clarke</a> is definitely one of the most&nbsp;beautiful women in Hollywood, so much so that <a href=#>Esquire </a>&nbsp;named her the most beautiful woman alive in 2015. And not only that, she also won B<a href=#>ritish GQ's Woman of the Year</a>. She is also one of the most successful actresses&nbsp; thanks in large part to starring in Game of Thrones. As the Mother of Dragons,&nbsp;Daenerys Targaryen has a long list of men whose heart she's broken. And in real life,&nbsp; did you know that she's one of Hollywood's A-listers who are perpetually single and doesn't fear living a life alone? As <a href=#>Clarke put it</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"People keep asking me who I'm dating right now, and the truth is...wait for [it]…no one. . . And that's OK. I'm figuring out a lot of stuff right now. I think as a woman it's in our nature to nurture someone else. Sometimes at the expense of ourselves."</strong></p><p>While she is not romantically linked to anyone now, she did have a long-distance relationship with <a href=#>Seth MacFarlane</a>, the creator of Family Guy, but that was four years ago. In a (very long!) <a href=#>profile of Clarke in Elle</a>, she said:</p><p>&nbsp;"It's funny. . .I've dated other people, but he [McFarlane] was the only one that the Internet found out about. But I kind of set myself with a little rule this year: NMA. No More Actors. And yet it's almost the only bloody choice; they're practically the only people I know!"</p><p>As for having children and being married, Clarke added, "Yes, I want babies. . . I don't know about marriage. That's probably quite a painfully millennial thing to say. But I do want to find a human that you'd want to create a family with." A human! Like rather than a farm animal?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=january-jones>January Jones</h2><p>January Jones, the former Mad Men actress, has just confessed why she favours being single after gossip mags said she was dating Bachelor alum Nick Viall, which wasn't true. According to an exclusive interview with <a href=#>Violet Grey</a>, Jones said:</p><p><strong>"After a series of disappointments, I’ve just gotten comfortable with myself, where I don’t need a partner to be happy. I’ve always liked living alone, and I rarely get lonely when I’m alone. The funny thing now, with having a son, is that I cherish those moments so much—just having a bath alone. Sometimes I think I’d be a great hermit."</strong></p><p>This is rare. Jones is confident; she doesn't need a man in her life to feel complete. Her confession&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;how she enjoys being alone is so refreshing. The mother of one, six-year-old Xander, <a href=#>added</a>&nbsp;that she is perfectly content co-parenting her son by herself. In that same profile, Jones elaborated:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I just don’t feel I need a partner. Do I want one? Maybe. But I don’t feel unhappy or lonely. It would have to be someone amazing that I would want to make room. Someone who would contribute to my happiness and not take away from it." But if she were to want a man in her life, she does have a particular type, jokingly saying,&nbsp;"I want a manly man in flannel, with a beard and an axe." You know, the Brawny paper-towel man!</p><h2 id=demi-lovato>Demi Lovato</h2><p>At age 18, the&nbsp;best former Disney star <a href=#>Demi Lovato </a>started <a href=#>confiding to the press</a> that she had been struggling to remain positive after finding out that she was suffering from many issues, mentally and physically that led her down a bad path. That's a lot to deal with and to take on, but Lovato has chosen to be open about her issues, <a href=#>saying</a>, “That’s something that’s a part of who I am and am always going to want to talk about.” Lovato added that having tons of caring fans helped her during dark times:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I have a really special relationship with my fans that I don’t think other artists have, and I’m really fortunate, so I want to incorporate them in every way possible.”</strong></p><p>These days, Lovato is single. In the past, she dated&nbsp; MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and&nbsp;<a href=#>Wilmer Valderrama</a>. But she's not heartbroken. <a href=#>In an interview with Sirius XM that was transcripted by TeenVogue</a>, she said, “I’ve always gone from relationship to relationship, or fling to fling, or whatever, like I’ve always had somebody in my life. . . ." But these days she's learning how to be single:&nbsp;“This time . . . for the first time, I’m not dating anybody. I’ve been enjoying being independent and living on my own and trying to navigate through adult life.”</p><p>In fact, Lovato has been particularly candid about not dating, saying "I’m learning how to be comfortable with being alone, and I think that’s the most important thing you can do for yourself, especially as a woman – to find your independence."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keke-palmer>Keke Palmer</h2><p>The Scream Queens actress, <a href=#>Keke Palmer</a>, is only 24, which is perhaps why she doesn't care that she's single. <a href=#>While appearing on a morning radio show</a>, when asked about her dating life, she said,</p><p><strong>“It’s very fun to be single, because you know what happens? You find yourself. You understand what it means to love yourself, instead of putting all this energy into give and tug in a relationship."</strong></p><p>Palmer is obviously not afraid to talk about being single. You can really find a lot about yourself if you're not dating and are alone. But she has only two choices, dating someone in the industry or dating someone who's not at all connected to it. She finds fault with both. In an <a href=#>interview with Essence</a>, she stated that if she dates someone in the industry she worries that the guy is only interested and excited about her career. And she admits&nbsp;that dating outside of Hollywood can be even more of a turn off than dating a fellow entertainer because he could be over-compensating to keep up with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At such a young age, Palmer seems wise beyond her years, as she knows the pitfalls of dating, particularly when you start leaning on your beloved for contentment and you lose all sense of yourself. She <a href=#>said</a>, "When you first fall in love, everything's all gravy. It's all good, it's all clean. And then you start depending on the other person for your happiness. And then it becomes a pull and tug between your egos. You want them to go your way, and they want you to go their way."</p><h2 id=lupita-nyong-o>Lupita Nyong'o</h2><p>A-list actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Lupita Nyong'o</a> hit it out of the ballpark when she starred in her first wide release film, 12 Years A Slave, and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lupita is currently single. Or maybe she's not. We've read multiple stories that suggest that&nbsp; <a href=#>Michael B. Jordan</a>, her Black Panther co-star, and Lupita are dating. And we've read even more stories that say they aren't. If she is, they'd become a powerful couple in Hollywood, having both starred in the mega-mega-mega hit Black Panther.&nbsp; According to <a href=#>USA Today</a>, fans are convinced that&nbsp;Michael and Lupita are dating because their body language suggests that while they are doing press events or other appearances. They exchange knowing looks, touch each other on the knee, and tap each other in a friendly manner. Yep, that's love! Just kidding! But Lupita would never share her private life. In an <a href=#>interview with Vogue</a>, she laughed and said,</p><p><strong>“You can ask, but you definitely won’t get an answer. . . There have been rumors and rumors and rumors about my love life. That’s the one area that I really like to hold close to my heart.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fine, we'll just ask Michael Jordan. In an <a href=#>interview with Wall Street Journal</a>, Jordan reveals what Lupita basically reiterated, that he likes to keep a low profile when it comes to talking about his private life. But when asked if he was seeing someone, he said it's tough dating in LA. And then he said, [but I am] “dating,” but&nbsp;that "he's technically single." What does that even mean? Should've just stuck to Lupita's response. Thanks, Michael!</p><h2 id=emma-watson>Emma Watson</h2><p>Emma Watson made it through the Harry Potter series and remained a bankable star when she starred in one of the biggest movies of all time, Beauty and the Beast. We hardly hear a peep out of her because she keeps a low profile.</p><p>But we want more from the star. We want to know if she's single or dating. Well, as <a href=#>reported by Page Six</a>, she's dating <a href=#>Chord Overstreet</a>, who starred in the hit comedy-musical Glee. An insider told Page Six, "It’s crazy but, yes, they are seeing each other, although Emma wants to keep things quiet and private.” But we guess it's who you talk to because another source said that they are&nbsp;only "friendly, but are not in a relationship.” Overstreet and Watson's reps did not comment on the report to Page Six.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On why she wants her dating life to be private, she said <a href=#>in an interview with Vanity Fair in 2017</a>: “I want to be consistent: I can’t talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You can’t have it both ways. . .&nbsp;I’ve noticed, in Hollywood, who you’re dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.”</p><h2 id=charlize-theron>Charlize Theron</h2><p><a href=#>Charlize Theron</a>, the A-list actress and winner of an Academy Award, is now a mother of two whom she adopted. But while it looks like she has it all, love for her is hard to come by.&nbsp;She dated singer <a href=#>Stephan Jenkins </a>for three years, actor Stuart Townsend for around nine years, and actor <a href=#>Sean Penn</a> since 2013. The United Nations messenger for peace was engaged to Penn but separated three years ago, in 2015. A <a href=#>Hollywood Life </a>insider said that Penn and Theron are still friends--<a href=#>they have been friends for decades before dating</a>--"but the romance has fizzled, hence her making the decision to call [the relationship] off. Just because they’re not together, that doesn’t mean the love between them still isn’t there." Thanks. You just lifted a line from a Graham Green novel!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, Theron is focused on caring for her kids.&nbsp;As she told Howard Stern, which <a href=#>People</a> later covered,&nbsp; if she decides to date, it has to be someone who is compatible with her children.</p><p>If she finds someone whom she really cares about, though, she doesn't necessarily need to marry: “Marriage to me is not that important. I want to have a partner and have a monogamous long-term relationship. . . But I don’t need to have a wedding. I don’t need the party. I don’t need the white dress.”</p><p>She's definitely a modern woman.</p><h2 id=bella-hadid>Bella Hadid</h2><p>In October 2017, fans rushed to Twitter to find consolation after they learned the hot couple <a href=#>Bella Hadid</a> and The Weeknd ended&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their relationship</a>&nbsp;after roughly 10 months. But the couple were talking to each other after their split and have remained good friends.&nbsp;The reason why fans believe the two have patched things up is because the two<a href=#>&nbsp;were spotted kissing</a> during the 2018 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival</a>&nbsp;in Indio, CA. According to an E! source,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>&nbsp;"Bella never really lost feeling for Abel and had hoped they would eventually get back together." But this doesn't mean they're dating. While the source says&nbsp;the ex-couple have been "secretly seeing each other recently" this news has not been verified and the relationship is not "official."&nbsp;</strong></p><p>That's because The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, has been "playing the field" and is "openly dating" other women. That doesn't sound like Bella and Abel are dating. Why would Bella, the Victoria's Secret model, want to date someone who is "openly dating?"</p><p>While The Weeknd quickly hooked up with Selena Gomez in the fall of 2017 (they have since split), he left the stunning model hanging.&nbsp; She told <a href=#>Teen Vogue</a>,&nbsp; “It was my first breakup. . . and so public. As an outsider, you might think I handled it so well, but it’s always in your heart, and you always feel it very heavily. It’ll be hard for a while. Love hurts, but you have to pull through.” Nicely put.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gigi-hadid>Gigi Hadid</h2><p><a href=#>Zayn Malik</a> and <a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a> have broken up after dating for more than two years. The singer, 25, and the model, 22, whose sister is Bella Hadid, also a model, broke up this past March. The two confirmed the separation&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in individual statements posted to Twitter</a>, and were last photographed together in New York City this past January. But their breakup has been amicable and it looks as if they are propping up each other. Here is the former One Direction singer's statement that he posted on his Twitter page:</p><p>"Gigi and I had an incredibly meaningful, loving and fun relationship and I have a huge amount of respect and adoration for Gigi as a woman and a friend. She has such an incredible soul. I'm grateful to all of our fans for respecting this difficult decision and our privacy at this time, we wish this news could have come from us first. We love you all."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here is Hadid's statement that she posted shortly after Malik's comment:&nbsp; "Breakup statements always seem impersonal because there is really no way to put into words what two people experience together over a few years ... not only in the relationship, but in life in general. I'm forever grateful for the love, time, and life lessons that Z and I shared. I want nothing but the best for him and will continue to support him as a friend that I have immense respect and love for.

Back then, Muggy c<a href=#>onfirmed he was seeing Megan</a>, saying "We did go on a date, that came out on Valentine’s Day. That was our first date. . . No one wants to be alone on that date. We went to Amsterdam... we had a good time!" A date on Valentine's Day? And a first one at that? Hmm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan is a British singer and reality star who has appeared on The Only Way Is Essex, otherwise known as "Towie."&nbsp; "Muggy Mike" Thalassitis, who is also British, is a former Cypriot footballer&nbsp;and also a reality TV star, starring in the hit The Love Island.</p><p>A source told <a href=#>The Sun Online</a> there was no "going back for the couple" and that the pair's ending is official.&nbsp;The break doesn't seem amicable, and neither Muggy nor Megan have divulged to their fans the reason for ending their short-lived romance. Since the news broke, The Sun Online added that Megan has gone back into the studio to complete her first record and that "[H]er music is her focus right now. She was in Wales pouring her heart out in really deep songs."</p><p>While they were still dating, <a href=#>Megan had this to say about Muggy</a>: "He gets on with my family, and he’s so lovely. When asked if Muggy might be "the one," Megan said,“Yes, definitely.” This was on April 17, only a week or so. The tragedy is that the two called it quits on April 24.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zendaya>Zendaya</h2><p>The actress <a href=#>Zendaya</a> became an instant superstar when she appeared in two of the biggest movies of 2017, Spider-Man: Homecoming and The Greatest Showman. But is she dating or is she single? Rumors have <a href=#>claimed</a> that she has been dating her Spider-Man co-star <a href=#>Tom Holland</a> since last July. A <a href=#>source from People</a> backed it up:</p><p><strong>“They started seeing each other while they were filming Spider-Man. . . They’ve been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye but they’ve gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another.”</strong></p><p>But according to <a href=#>Elite Daily</a>, when Tom and Zendaya saw that comment on Twitter, they laughed off the rumours. But since the two never actually denied they were dating, many took this to believe that the rumours were true. But it sounds as if they are just having fun. They're both young and they like to joke around. They could just have great chemistry. They could just be friends. In fact, according to Holland, they may just be that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>He said,</a>"We're the best of friends.

So now what?</p><h2 id=la-la-anthony>La La Anthony</h2><p>La La Anthony got her big break by appearing on MTV's TRL. She married <a href=#>Carmelo Anthony</a>, a professional basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association, in 2o10. It's a long marriage by Hollywood's standards,&nbsp;but in April 2017, Anthony was with a woman, who worked at a NYC gentleman's club, and she claims<a href=#> the basketball star got her pregnant</a>, according to Page Six. And,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to TMZ</a>, the woman demanded cash for medical expenses and other costs in relation to having his baby. A source for TMZ confided that, even before the unexpected news, which devastated Anthony, the marriage had been "rocky for a while -- and while the pregnancy wasn't the tipping point, it certainly didn't help."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The larger question, of course, is if La La would ever get over her husband who&nbsp;did that to&nbsp;her. Maybe not, as she revealed she was p<a href=#>reparing herself </a>to the life of dating:</p><p>“I’m trying to get myself in order. I’m in the gym every day. I’m eating right. I’m taking out all the bad stuff in my life and just really dating and focusing on myself, which is something women need to do more often, put ourselves first.”</p><p>We agree! This hottie is going to be scooped up in a matter of time!</p><h2 id=claire-holt>Claire Holt</h2><p>How is it that the Australian beauty&nbsp;Claire Holt, famous for her roles in The Vampire Diaries and its spin-off The Originals, is still single?&nbsp; She married her husband, TV producer Matthew Kaplan, in 2016. The short-lived relationship lasted one year, and it was Kaplan, not Holt, who filed for divorce just<a href=#> one day shy of their first anniversary</a> in 2017. According to court papers, Kaplan cited irreconcilable differences for the split.&nbsp;Claire has since responded to the filing on May 2 and <a href=#>requested to take back her maiden name</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But even if her private life is in the midst of dissolving, Claire has lots to be thankful for, as she is now one of the hottest young stars in Hollywood. Her show <a href=#>The Vampire Diaries</a> was such a hit that it aired 8 seasons. That's 171 episodes from 2009 to 2017! Claire appeared on the cult show for 88 episodes and then went on to star in the series, The Originals.</p><p>But if you think Claire is sad being single, or feeling like a loser as she goes about town alone, think again. She's been spotted several times for events and she's always alone.&nbsp; And she always looks happy and poses for the cameras. For example, Claire looked stunning and posed demurely for the paps when she flew solo to attend a Q&A event in New York to discuss her film 47 Meters Down in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adriana-lima>Adriana Lima</h2><p>Adriana Lima is an example of someone who is both beautiful and permanently single. This is not to say that she doesn't date. She does, and she has had a doozy of relationships with a lot of high-profile men, including singer <a href=#>Lenny Kravitz</a>, <a href=#>Derek Jeter</a>, football star <a href=#>Julian Edelman</a> and Mets pitcher Matt Harvey. But the relationships do not last, which means she's single a lot of times. The last person whom she <a href=#>dated was Metin Hara, a Turkish author, this past spring</a>, but that ended too. But it doesn't seem to be that Lima needs a man on her arm all the time.</p><p><strong>When she attended this year's Academy Awards, she went alone. According to<a href=#> People</a>&nbsp;in 2017, she confirmed, "Yes I am single."</strong></p><p>At the same time, the Brazilian beauty showed off a new diamond band on her ring finger that she bought for herself.&nbsp; “What’s up with the ring?” she asked. “It’s symbolic, I am committed to myself and my own happiness I am married with me. Ladies love yourself.” About the post, she clarified to <a href=#>ET</a>:&nbsp; “It’s talking about loving yourself. That’s how everything starts. If you’re incapable of loving your own self, how can you love anyone else in your life, if you don’t know how to embrace you?” Lima was spot-on. You do need to love yourself first.

That she still cared for Musk led the two to start dating again, but the on-again, off-again&nbsp;duo called it quits a second time,<a href=#> after only about 2 months of dating</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2016, after divorcing Depp, <a href=#>a source told People</a> the usual story after a breakup, the claim that the actress is focusing on work now that she is single: “She wants a more positive focus on her. She is an actress and wants to just focus on work now."</p><p>Heard had been spending most of her time in London to prepare for her role&nbsp; in the DC film Justice League. In 2019, she will reprise her role in Aquaman. Now that she's in the DC clan, Heard will blow up and become part of Hollywood's elite. Until then, we have to guess about who she's dating.</p><h2 id=rebecca-gayheart>Rebecca Gayheart</h2><p>Former model Rebecca Gayheart may be 46, but she's still a&nbsp;beauty in our playbook.&nbsp; Now we can dream about being alone with her--just kidding, we don't want to seem creepy!--because after 14 years of marriage, Rebecca filed for divorce from former Grey's Anatomy star <a href=#>Eric Dane</a><a href=#>citing irreconcilable differences</a>&nbsp;in February 2018. They were married in 2004 and have two daughters.

It's rare for a TV commercial star to break into Hollywood, but she did exactly that because of her good looks and her fresh face. She landed on the soap opera Loving in 1992 and in 1995, she&nbsp;starred in the hit teen drama Beverly Hills, 90210. But she is most famous for a tape that was leaked online.</p><h2 id=priyanka-chopra>Priyanka Chopra</h2><p><a href=#>Priyanka Chopra</a> is a global sensation both in Bollywood and Hollywood. She starred in several Bollywood movies in her hometown of India before jumping ship to the US to find success on the hit TV show Quantico, as well as a starring role in 2016's Baywatch, opposite <a href=#>Dwayne Johnson</a>.

In 2017, however, Priyanka did open up to say that she was in a committed relationship, but that was only for a brief time and she's currently single. And not only that, she's perpetually single. There's her global non-stop career to blame. But the main reason that she's been single for "<a href=#>a very long time</a>" is because she has yet to find that special someone. That's partly due to her iconic stature, as well as her high standards. And in fact, she herself told <a href=#>The Times of India</a> that she is yet to come across a "suitable match for herself" and that it seems to be "a difficult task for her." She is following her mother's advice, to marry a man "who can appreciate the hard work that she has done until now."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the meantime, while holding out for Mr. Right, Priyanka has been staying very busy.
