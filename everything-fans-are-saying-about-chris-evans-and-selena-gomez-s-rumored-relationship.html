Many fans online have been shipping them, but after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they were seen photographed together</a>, allegedly leaving a restaurant and recording studio on the same day, which were posted by an independent entertainment blog. Could there be any truth to that rumor?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After some digging from fans, it turns out that the rumors are just that rumors and that the photos are fake and were taken at two separate times- Gomez's were from 2017 and 2019 while Evans' were 2013 and 2020. Elle was also quick to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">debunk these rumors</a> also.</p><p>Even though there most likely isn't a truth to this "relationship," the internet seems to ship it. Here's what fans are saying about Chris Evans and <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>'s rumored relationship.</p><h2 id=gomez-on-evans><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Gomez On Evans</span></h2><p>Not only were those fake photos leaked, but Chris Evans started following Selena Gomez on Instagram, which sparked the rumors even farther. She eventually followed him back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gomez talked about having a crush on the actor</a> back in 2005 on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “I kind of have a crush on Chris Evans. Isn’t he cute? He’s very cute." It was her first time sharing her crush on him and she added, “Oh man, he’s either going to hate me or love me.”</p><h2 id=chris-evans-39-relationship-history><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Chris Evans' Relationship History</span></h2><p>Chris Evans is one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors and has his fair share of girls and flings. Despite the rumors of him and Gomez and Lizzo flirting with him on Instagram, here are the women who he has actually been linked to. Him and Kate Bosworth had a short-term relationship after meeting on a movie set in 2000. Perhaps one of his longest and notable relationships was with Jessica Biel. They started dating in 2001 and broke-up in 2006. In 2011, the Captain America star briefly dated Dianna Agron. Lily Collins supposedly dated the actor in 2015, but things seemed to fizzle out pretty quickly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-39-s-past-relationships><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Selena Gomez's Past Relationships</span></h2><p>Sadly, Gomez and Evans are not a couple, but the singer has had her fair share of relationships. Most notably, she was in an on-again off-again relationship with<strong><a href=#> Justin Bieber</a></strong> and the two finally called it quits in 2018. Some other high-profile relationships, she was in were with The Weeknd in 2017, Nick Jonas in 2008 and Taylor Lautner in 2009. The Only Murders in the Building actress is also very close friends with Niall Horan and the internet has wanted them to date since 2015.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Male Celebs Who Dated Selena Gomez Since Her Rise To Fame</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-39-re-such-a-power-couple><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They're Such A Power Couple</span></h2><p>Most people are on board with these two potentially being in a relationship. One Twitter user wrote, "Bro I am not mad about this rumor Selena Gomez and Chris Evans are such a power couple." And it is true. If they in fact, did date, they very much would be a power couple. Evans is one of the biggest actors of our time, thanks to Marvel and Gomez is currently dominating streaming TV. Too bad they have to crush everyone's hearts.</p><h2 id=i-39-m-glad-it-39-s-selena><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>I'm Glad It's Selena</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Honestly if someone was going to date my man chris evans then I’m glad it’s Selena Gomez," @jendaydreams posted on Twitter. Many people pine after the 39-year-old because of his good looks and his kind demeanor. Gomez is also a loved celebrity, so fans would be happy if the two were actually dating. If Evans has to be with someone, fans would totally support him with Gomez.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Chris Evans And Other Celebrities Who Get Along Really Well With Their Siblings</a></span></p><h2 id=it-gives-me-so-much-hope><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>It Gives Me So Much Hope</span></h2><p>"If Selena Gomez is really dating Chris Evans that gives me so much hope about going from toxic boys to a DAMN MAN," @nat_gras tweeted. This is in reference to her relationship with Justin Bieber, who was very <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">toxic on her mental health</a>. Even though, Evans is a decade older than her, maybe that's what she needs- a man who will be mature in a relationship after the set backs she has had in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=manifesting-it><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Manifesting It</span></h2><p>A tweet read, "I think we all can agree that @ChrisEvans and @selenagomez would be such a powerful couple," which many fans online have stressed. Now that the rumors were going around the same Twitter user quoted their tweet with "Day 30 manifesting Chris Evans and Selena Gomez dating!!!!" So even, if none of this is true, the demand and love for it is there. Who knows, maybe Evans will hit Gomez up in her DMs.</p><h2 id=i-don-39-t-want-to-live-in-this-world><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>I Don't Want To Live In This World</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another supportive fan tweeted, "Okay but If selena gomez and chris evans don’t actually end up together, I don’t want to live in this world." And that is very relatable right there. Clearly, the demand is there for them to be a couple. It might just be only a matter of time. That is, if Lizzo doesn't stop Gomez in her tracks. So, please start dating, so people can want to live in this world again, guys. Thanks.</p><h2 id=we-need-answers><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>We Need Answers</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan was very brave and tagged the celebrities on Twitter telling them we need answers. "@ChrisEvans @selenagomez we needs answers!!!! Are y’all dating? #powercouplegoals," wrote @zeebee919. Neither one of the actors have commented on the situation, but since the photos were not real anyway, there is really nothing to comment on. Judging by Gomez's comments in the past, it seems as though she would be for it. Now, Evans just has to be on board and they can rule Hollywood.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Selena Gomez Has Recently Revealed About Her Personal Struggles</a></span></p><h2 id=not-for-it><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Not For It</span></h2><p>On the flip side of things, there are very few negative comments about the rumored relationship. Most people are here for it, and some were disappointed that it's not real, but others do not want it to happen. "Imma big fans of both chris evans and selena gomez. But ain't for shipping them together," wrote @titoAPN. Another Twitter user just wrote "Chris Evans and Selena Gomez? No No No No No." We don't know the reasons for why these fans are against it, but they do not have to worry anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no truth to this rumor, but if it did happen, it seems as though many people would be on board with it.</p><p><span class=related-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Quotes About Chris Evans (From His Past Girlfriends)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZJ%2BZnqh6or7EZqqasZmjtG6twaisrWWTnb%2Bqv4yerZqmo2Kur7CMrJylnZ6Weqi7zJ6xrGWiqrqwvsSdZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
