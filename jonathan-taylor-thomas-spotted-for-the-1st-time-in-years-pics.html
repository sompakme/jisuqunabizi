The Pennsylvania native <a href=#>starred in four episodes</a> of the series between 2013 and 2015. He also directed three episodes of the sitcom.</p><p>Before that, Thomas <a href=#>took a step away from the spotlight</a>. After <a href=#>exiting Home Improvement in 1998</a> to focus on school — he graduated from Chaminade College Preparatory School and later attended Harvard University and Columbia University — he didn’t look for a leading part. Instead, he landed guest spots on 8 Simple Rules and Veronica Mars and voiced six episodes of The Wild Thornberrys.</p><p>“You can’t be trapped in this bubble called the acting industry,” the I’ll Be Home for Christmas actor told Premiere magazine in 1996. “The industry is neurotic and weird, and so when I go home and I play basketball with my friends, I’m not Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m just Jonathan. I don’t like hanging out with other actors and actresses.”</p><p>In 1999, he noted that he made the right choice by leaving the family sitcom. “Had I stayed at the show and tried to do academically what I’m doing now, I would’ve, you know, put myself in an early grave,” he said at the time.</p><p>Although he’s remained private, <a href=#><strong>Devon Sawa</strong></a>, who starred alongside Thomas in 1997’s Wild America, gave an update on the actor in 2019. “I <a href=#>spoke to Jonathan a month ago</a> for the first time in a long time,” he told Us exclusively at the time.</p><p><strong>For more hot celebrity news, listen to Us Weekly editors dish on top topics & trends with these clips from the Hot Hollywood Podcast!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p>In the ’90s, Thomas was honest about starting his career so early and not knowing if acting was really what he wanted to do with his life.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You should be focused on doing a good job, but every job has an end,” Thomas, who <a href=#>voiced the young Simba in The Lion King</a> in 1994, told Premiere. “You can’t base your life around one thing. So that’s why I focus on school, I play sports, I learn the technical side of [filmmaking]. Because sometime it’ll change, and I’ll have my education to fall back on.”</p><p>See the latest photos of Thomas below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt7C6wK2fmqZdqa66uM6rZK2gn6KutHnSqaatrJWZeqe70WaroZ1dZsC1edOipJ5lmaN6urHAq6pmqJmYwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
