She also won 14 Grammy Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marilyn Monroe, an iconic film actress who knew how to use her star power, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a friendship</a> with the These Foolish Things singer until Monroe's tragic death.</p><p>According to celebrity.nine.au, when Monroe was asked who her favorite singers were, the star responded, "Well, my very favorite person, and I love her as a person as well as a singer, I think she's the greatest, and that's Ella Fitzgerald." Monroe and Fitzgerald were friends, and Monroe also helped give Fitzgerald's star status a nudge in the right direction.</p><p>The two met in November of 1954, when the singer performed in Los Angeles and Monroe attended. Becoming friends, Monroe learned Fitzgerald hadn't been able to perform at The Mocambo Club - a famous club at the time.</p><p>The Gentlemen Prefer Blondes actress convinced the owner of The Mocambo Club that Fitzgerald should perform. Worried Fitzgerald didn't have what it took to draw an audience, he initially turned her down. Then Monroe offered to bring an audience of celebrities, ensuring she herself would be in the front row, but only if the singer performed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fitzgerald said, "I know I make a lot of money now at the jazz clubs I play, but I sure wish I could play at one of those fancy places."</p><p>The Cheek to Cheek singer told the press at a later time, "I owe Marilyn Monroe a real debt... she personally called the owner of The Mocambo, and told him she wanted me booked immediately, and if he would do it, she would take a front table every night."</p><p>"She told him - and it was true, due to the Marilyn's superstar status - that the press would go wild. After that, I never had to play a small jazz club again. She was an unusual woman - a little ahead of her times. And she didn't know it."</p><p>The club manager happily agreed to this type of publicity, and once Fitzgerald took the stage and began to sing, she no longer needed Monroe's help to bring in an audience. Fitzgerald sold out the club each night, and the owner reportedly extended her contract an extra week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=if-fitzgerald-wasn-39-t-allowed-to-enter-the-front-doors-monroe-refused-to-enter-the-venue>If Fitzgerald Wasn't Allowed To Enter The Front Doors, Monroe Refused To Enter The Venue</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar24776834.jpg><p>Ella Fitzgerald is known for having one of the greatest voices; she never sang out of tune. One of the people she inspired with her singing was the iconic actress, Marilyn Monroe. Monroe was a celebrity who took advantage of her star power; <a href=#>when photos were published in Playboy without her permission, Monroe turned things back in her favor</a>.</p><p>Before everyone knew how talented Ella Fitzgerald was, Marilyn Monroe loved the singer's voice. Reportedly, on the advice of her vocal coach, Monroe bought one of Fitzgerald's albums, and listened to it again and again. She had fallen in love with the voice of "The First Lady of Song".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Fitzgerald rose to national fame, there was push-back against the celebrated singer because of her race. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monroe shared a friendship with Fitzgerald</a>, and Monroe supported her friend.</p><p>When a club owner in Colorado refused to allow Fitzgerald to enter through the front door because she was black, the Some Like It Hot actress told the owner she wouldn't be entering his building at all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Hollywood Is Still Obsessed With Marilyn Monroe</a></span></p><p>"According to Fitzgerald biographer Geoffrey Mark, Monroe had traveled to Colorado to see Fitzgerald perform. Once there, she saw her friend ushered away from the front entrance, so Monroe refused to go inside unless both she and Fitzgerald were allowed through the front doors," according to Biography.com.</p><p>"Monroe got her way and soon all of Fitzgerald's performances spots were treating the singer with the respect she deserved."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Monroe was more than a fan of "The Queen of Jazz", the two were also friends in real life.</p><h2 id=the-two-were-close-friends>The Two Were Close Friends</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Marilyn-Monroe.jpg><p>Marilyn Monroe and Ella Fitzgerald respected each other, each other's talents and <a href=#>were close friends in life</a>. Although Fitzgerald and Monroe were good friends, they might have been even closer.</p><p>According to Far Out Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monroe and Fitzgerald shared a friendship</a>, but they had certain differences in their lifestyles. "Monroe's struggle with addiction drove a wedge in their friendship from time to time, as Fitzgerald kept more of a quiet life and preferred to stay away from drugs and alcohol."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Photos That Make Us Miss Marilyn Monroe</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, Fitzgerald wasn't in attendance at Monroe's funeral. This wasn't because of a falling out, or any bad feelings. <a href=#>Monroe's ex-husband, Joe DiMaggio</a>, had arranged Monroe's funeral.</p><p>Wanting the event to be small and private, DiMaggio didn't invite any of her celebrity friends or acquaintances. It seems the baseball star might have made an exception for certain friends, such as Fitzgerald, a person whose friendship and music had meant so much to Monroe in life.</p><p>Monroe and Fitzgerald shared a friendship until Monroe's tragic death in 1962.
