And I will remember that character for the rest of my life.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></a>, for her part, recalled <a href=#>having a “magical” summer fling</a> with Perry in 1993 via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Sunday. “He had shot the pilot of Friends but it had not aired yet. He was nervous, hoping <a href=#>his big break was just around the corner</a>. It was,” she captioned a photo of Perry. “We stayed friends for a while until we drifted apart, but I was always happy to see him when I did. I am super sad today, as so many of us are. I hope Matthew is at peace at long last. I really do.”</p><p>Perry’s family — he is survived by dad <strong>John Bennett Perry</strong>, mom <strong>Suzanne Morrison</strong> and stepdad <strong>Keith Morrison</strong> — stated that they are “<a href=#>heartbroken by the tragic loss</a> of our beloved son and brother” in a statement to <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a> on Sunday. “Matthew brought so much joy to the world, both as an actor and a friend.
