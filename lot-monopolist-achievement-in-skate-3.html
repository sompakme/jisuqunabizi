Lot challenges can only be enter when you sign up to any lot. There are 11 lots in total:<br>Campus Entrance:<p>*Campus calamity<br>Score 8000 points in 90 seconds.</p><p>*Round the rosey<br>Two minutes for 5000 points.</p><p>*Grass 'n grind<br>Left grass gap<br>Right gap into the bank<br>Grind the stair set</p><p>*Sheddin' skin<br>A minute to gap the middle pane. Not hard at all.</p><p>*Spin out<br>Just 360 any grab over the gap within the 45 seconds and you are go.</p><p>*The super kinker<br>You need to clear the stairs with a 1000 point grind and it's giving you 45 seconds to do so. No problem. You'd have to try hard to not get 1000.</p><p>*Glass walls<br>Two minutes for this... just grind the glass wall and get 500 points. Flip in and/or out and done.</p><p>*Campus bridge list<br>Do a late flip<br>Handplant the bowl<br>Gap the north stairset<br>Gap the south stairset<br>Do a nosegrind<br>Grass gap between the trees<br>500 point grind<br>500 point grab<br>Footplant to grind<br>Grind the top edge of the bowl</p><p>You've got five minutes for all these objectives. The only thing you need to know is to roll from the top of the hill to easily get to the top of the bowl.</p><p>Carverton Memorial Park:</p><p>*Monumental points<br>15000 in two minutes. The best things I found to trick off are the two flower beds. Flip in and out of grinds with them and you're good.</p><p>*Grinds n' roses<br>Grind the planter<br>Grind around the memorial wall<br>Gap and grind from plaque to planter</p><p>You're given a minute to these. Again, you don't need to grind all the way around the memorial. However for the dumb gap to planter you need to grind all the way to the arrow for it to count.</p><p>*Paved homage<br>Gap the short stair<br>Gap the long stair<br>Grind the high ledge<br>Grind under the archway</p><p>One minute to complete these line of sorts.</p><p>*War memory gaps<br>Gap the rail into the rolling bank<br>Grind stone to gap stairs</p><p>Thirty seconds to complete this simple task. Get to it.</p><p>*Memorial<br>Grind the stone hubba<br>Gap the stairs<br>Manual or grind off the final ledge</p><p>45 seconds for a one try task.</p><p>*Stone cemetery tag<br>There's a dozen spots you need to hit within the three minutes. If you have issues, drop-in off of them.</p><p>*Divide and grinder<br>Five spots you need to net 500 points on within 90 seconds. Once you do the first you'll have a multiplier keep and it'll be easy.</p><p>*Memorial manual mile<br>Manual the course<br>Manual to grind the stair ledge</p><p>A minute to manny down the hill and then ollie from that to a grind.</p><p>*Drop and roll<br>Method the archway within 30 seconds. Just roll down the hill and take the speed for air and done done done.</p><p>*Tricks of tribute<br>Do a 180 tail grab<br>Grind the backside ledge<br>540 tweak grab<br>Grind the top ledge<br>Handplant the top ledge<br>Gap the backside ledge<br>Gap under the left wreath<br>Gap under the right wreath<br>Gap the centre insert<br>Air into the arms of the soldier</p><p>Only four minutes this time. Probably because of the simplicity. The only difficulty should be gaping that centre ledge. I did that from the top drop. Simply drop the right and start going left, ollie big and done.</p><p>Chan Center:</p><p>*Grind session<br>Score 2000 points or more on the rails inside of two minutes</p><p>*Simple grind<br>Do a grind to clear the stairs within the 90 seconds time limit.</p><p>*Rainbow Grind tag<br>Grind six benches within the given two minutes.</p><p>*Curves and grind<br>You've got two minutes to grind the four planters. They're arranged in a circle for you.</p><p>*Stair counters rejoice<br>Either gap or grind the stairway. You've got 90 seconds. Get some speed for a simple gap.</p><p>*Trick list trial<br>Do any fliptrick down the ramp<br>Grind the rail<br>Do a grab down the ramp<br>200 point trick down the ramp<br>Grind the inside ledge<br>Grind the outside ledge<br>Trick out of the grind down the ramp<br>400 point trick down the ramp</p><p>You've got three minutes to complete these simple goals.</p><p>Harborside:</p><p>*Count the cargo<br>You've got three minutes thirty to score 9000 points. The box rail right in front of you is the best obstacle here in my opinion. Hit it, then the slanted rail on the right, turn around and repeat.</p><p>*Can you cope?<br>You need grind a distance of 70 meters within the given three minute time limit. Best bet in my opinion is just two three pushes, grinding and resetting instead of pushing in the bowl and hitting the coping.</p><p>*I'm on a boat<br>Just do the gap between the two pipes on the boat and you're golden. You even get two minutes thirty to try.</p><p>*Scrap metal<br>Manual on and off the propeller<br>Transfer between the quarter pipes<br>Gap from scrap metal to bank</p><p>Two minutes for very easy goals. Get to it and land it in one go.</p><p>*Boat launch<br>You get a bunch of time, three minutes, to rocket air into the boat. Very simple with so much air time. Just know that the on screen combo is to be done in order, not at once.</p><p>*Titanic transfer</p><p>I'd recommend switching to easy for this gap. You've got three minutes to hit it, but you'll be going at quite some speed and you have to adjust your course as soon as you land. There's a simple movie embedded to the right. The first cam is for an overview, the other is the game cam so you can see what I did.</p><p>*Legendary<br>You have to grind all eight ledges within the three minutes. If you're having issues hitting them, just caveman them or drop in. still counts sadly.</p><p>*Just tricks<br>360 spin over the grass<br>Do a 8 metre grind<br>Gap to the rail<br>Step-up over the stairs<br>Do a gymnast plant<br>Grind the high ledge<br>Grind the ledge in the corner<br>Grind either high rail<br>750 point trick<br>No comply on the pad</p><p>Five minutes for a few easy objectives. You can easily combine a few of these. For instance the high ledge and the 8 metre grind. The 750 can be done nearly anywhere. Easy stuff.</p><p>*Bricklynn Style<br>Ollie over the block<br>Grind barrier, drop into the bank<br>Do a slide on the spine<br>360 over the left crane's base<br>Manual down the stairs<br>500 points on the rail<br>Grind the right crane's base<br>Trick over the post<br>Grind the back of the block<br>Gap down the sideways stairs</p><p>Five minutes to beat them all. The hardest part is orientating yourself, the rest is a piece of cake.</p><p>New Factory:</p><p>*Getting whipped<br>You've got a 30000 point target and three minutes thirty to get it.</p><p>*Roof gap<br>Make the roof gap. You've got three minutes. As long as you crouch long enough before hand you shouldn't have any issues making the gap.</p><p>*Pipe bomb<br>Make the pipe transfer within the given three minutes. Basically there's a gap in the pipe and you want to transfer up and over the closed bit into the other open one.</p><p>*Transfer party<br>There are eight transfers and you've got to make all of them within four minutes.</p><p>*Loading bay<br>Seven ledges to hit within two minutes thirty. I'd recommend doing this on normal difficulty. Easy you can overshoot the grind, hard it's difficult to hit because the bank magnet is stronger than the grind magnet.</p><p>*Concrete grinder<br>You've got three minutes to hit all eight ledges.</p><p>*Worst.Activity.Ever<br>Grind all seven stair rails inside of the three minutes. You'll have to caveman on. Very annoying.</p><p>*Bring your own grind<br>800 point grind in three minutes. Three rails to choose from. Flip in, grind all the way and flip out.</p><p>*Sick list<br>Grind the fence on the bank<br>Slide on a pole jam<br>Nose manual the wide ledge<br>Lateflip over the couch<br>1500 point trick<br>Footplant on any ledge<br>360 flip to a ledge<br>Manny flip manny on the slate<br>Hippy jump the rail<br>Grind the low fence</p><p>Five minutes to get them all. None of these are very hard and you've got plenty of time to navigate the ghetto spot. To get the 1500 just build up a multiplier.</p><p>Park'n'Play:</p><p>*Parking Points<br>Garner 10000 points in 90 seconds. Personally I like going immediately right and hitting the long ledge in the middle. Just to build my my multiplier up to 3x, after that, even flat can get then 10k in that time.</p><p>*Triple stair tricks<br>Fliptrick the first stairs<br>Lateflip the second stairs<br>Fingerflip the third stairs</p><p>You've got three minutes to these, the last being the hardest, however, you can do any form of grab flip variation. It doesn't need to be a real fingerflip (nosegrab fingerflip), it can even be a varial. Just do a grab and move the stick about circular after and you are bound to land something.</p><p>*Tollbooth gap<br>500 point gap tollbooth platform<br>700 point gap the access ramp</p><p>One minute to do these two gaps. They're pretty easy, just add some body spin. You should have all the speed you need from the drop.</p><p>*Drop, gap and grind it!<br>500 points off the ledge<br>Gap the access ramp<br>Grind the ledge</p><p>Three minutes for three objectives. That first drop almost nets you 500 with an advanced flip trick. With the speed you've got the gap is no issue and a light ollie should get you up to that ledge no issue.</p><p>*No exit? No problem!<br>500 point gap across pathway<br>1500 point gap over ledge</p><p>You've got three minutes even though you should only require one attempt. These gaps are worth more than the points required, so a simple ollie will do.</p><p>*Lamp hoppin'<br>90 seconds to trick around all five lamp posts. Shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>*Parallel parking<br>Three minutes to do a 5-0 grind on a ledge either side of the path. Even that low orang ledge. Just grind all the way to the bottom.</p><p>*Ride the wave<br>Do a grind worth 500 points on the "wave" within three minutes and you're golden. Again, even the curbs count. Just flip in and you should be good.</p><p>*Rooftop riot<br>Gap to grind the access ramp ledge<br>Grind down the sloped planter<br>Gap up any stairs<br>Score a 600 point grind<br>Gap the two parked cars<br>Trick around a lower lamppost<br>Grind a white barrier<br>Do a grab grind<br>Do a 18 meter grind<br>Grind the high corner ledge</p><p>There's ten goals and you've got five minutes. Right away you can combine the gap to grind and 600 point grind objective. From here head left to gap the lamppost then left again and up the hill. Gap up the steps to the right here. Set a marker up here, then gap the two cars. Reset and this time head for the planter. Grab while grinding and you should also being doing the 18 metres as long as you didn't ollie too far. Reset again and hit up the barrier behind you and finally the high ledge. If you launch over it, just use it for a drop in.</p><p>Quarry:</p><p>*The long way down<br>You need to score 25000 points total within the three minutes. You're going down the quarry. Best advise is to build up your speed and air that first gap. You should get your multiplier easy. Keep it steady and simple to keep it alive. Maintain your speed and you should have the 25k by the time you reach the last gap.</p><p>*Rusty dishes<br>You've got three minutes to attempt this. Basically you need drop down into these dishes and hop across to the next and over the truck at the end. I can only recommend switching to easy mode and even then, it's a PITA. If you can't make that gap to the last dish, you can try footplanting or even getting off your deck.</p><p>*Roof drop<br>Drop off the roof into the bank<br>Make the first gap<br>Make the second gap</p><p>Three easy goals within 90 seconds. They're all in one line, the only thing you need to be aware of is the relatively sharp turn after the bank.</p><p>*Flat blaster<br>Gap to the flatbed<br>Air over the dumpster</p><p>Three minutes for this one. The hardest part here is actually getting to the flatbed gap. Once you've tried it and see how to get there it's easy though. Just be sure to time the ollies right.</p><p>*Barrier Kult<br>Hit up the five barriers within the 105 seconds... I'd tell you to do it Deerman style, but you can't in the game. They cheated and put these on massive banks to make it possible. Fix the physics instead.</p><p>*Bank job<br>There are four bank to bank transfers you need to clear within three minutes. Just hit them one way, then the other.</p><p>*Where is stairbank?<br>A ridiculous three minutes to net a mere 250 points on the bank or stairs. Just roll up to the bank and do a tre flip.</p><p>*Hucking rocks<br>540 spin any gap<br>720 spin any transfer<br>Grind across the first or second gap<br>Lateflip + fingerflip any transfer<br>Manual across the first or second gap<br>Tweak two grabs on any transfer<br>9000 points on the second gap<br>Underflip across any gap<br>Back or frontflip any transfer</p><p>Five minutes for all these goals. The way I do it is roll up to the first and slow so I can do the grind. Then I attempt the 720 or lateflip+fingerflip at the transfer, but rarely get it, probably too slow. Slow down for the second gap and manny across. Do the two tweaks at this transfer and the 540 at the gap. If I managed the lateflip+fingerflip or 720, then I'll add in the underflip here. Now I reset back to the top. Do the underflip across the gap, then the lateflip+fingerflip at the transfer. Get the 9k across the next gap, with multiplier you only need to spin a one foot grab. Then I try and get the 720 off the transfer. Reset one last time for the bodyflip and you're done. One important thing to remember is to not ollie the transfers, especially for the 720 it is exceptionally detrimental.</p><p>Rippon Towers:</p><p>*Rippon tower points<br>Within three minutes you need to score 10000 points. Best thing you can do is head for the rail right in front of you and then hit the one right after. That way you'll net some decent points and often end up with x3 multiplier.</p><p>*Streetside ledge points<br>Another ten thousand within three minutes. This one's easy. You've got a bunch of ledges in front of you. Hit them up, get your multiplier, ride to the end and repeat.</p><p>*Grind-2-grind gaps<br>Upper grind-2-grind gap<br>Lower grind-2-grind gap</p><p>I definitely recommend easy mode for this. You've got three minutes for the two gaps and that is more than enough time. In hardcore mode you need luck more than skill in easy it's simple.</p><p>*Plaza path perfection<br>Grind the ledge<br>Grind around the water<br>600 point gap into the plaza</p><p>Three minutes for all the goals. The ledge is right in front of you, that planter up top and from there you can roll straight to the 600 point gap. You don't need to do the complete grind around the water, so just ollie off to the left when you think you're going to fall off.</p><p>*Rippon Run<br>250 points over the first stair<br>500 points over the second stair<br>800 points over the third stair</p><p>Three minutes for this one. As long as you do it all in one line, it should be a simple job. Just watch out for the last, if you gap too far you'll bail because of the top frame.</p><p>*Ribbon plaza tag<br>There's a total of fifteen spots you need to hit within the given three minutes. Try and fine lines that work for you, else you'll be wasting time just rolling around. The game doesn't mention it, but for a lot of these your character needs to go through the blue arrow, else whatever you do won't count. Annoying as hell.</p><p>*Arch decko<br>You need to grind and flip out within three minutes. No difficulty here.</p><p>*Triple ledge alley<br>A simple 500 point grind within the minute on any of ledges will do. You need to land on those arrows at the end for it to count.</p><p>*Plaza patio gap<br>Just do a 360 across the gap within the three minutes and you're fine. Ridiculous how much time you get for this simple objective.</p><p>*Ribbon Tricks<br>500 point trick<br>Do a 540<br>Nosegrab off the centre ribbon<br>Transfer to the left ribbon<br>Transfer to wall ride the right ribbon<br>Tweak a 360 grab<br>Make the back to back ribbon transfer<br>Grind the top of the back wall ribbon<br>Grab grind under the ribbon<br>1000 point trick</p><p>Five minutes like all the other trick lists. If you do it right, you can easily get the speed required to do the 540, nosegrab and points right off the bat. The gaps should be doable easy. Grinding the top of the back wall ribbon is a challenge... however I just grinded the bottom right, on the inside and it counted. The 1000 points are easy off that first air where you needed to do the nosegrab.</p><p>Super Ultra Megapark:</p><p>*The mega bowl<br>Thirty grand in three minutes. The multiplier is more important than the speed, however if you lose it, reset.</p><p>*El quadro<br>800 point grind the long ledge<br>Manual across the blue pad<br>Gap from the hump into channel<br>Tweak a handplant on the end wall</p><p>They're giving you three minutes and as such, you shouldn't have a problem.</p><p>*Quarters and gaps<br>1500 point trick off the wall<br>3000 point trick off the high gap<br>4000 point trick off the low gap</p><p>Keep your speed and you've got this in the bag, don't throw it away with a bail. It's a sixty second countdown of anxiety.</p><p>*Western Gaps<br>Transfer into the steep drop<br>Air over the small spine<br>Air over the big spine<br>Transfer over the arch</p><p>Three minutes for a few simple tasks. Keep your speed and stay on course and you'll do fine.</p><p>*Spin to win<br>There are five spots you need to 540 spin inside of 90 seconds. Remember, don't ollie.</p><p>*Flip it, flip it good<br>You've got 90 seconds to do a body flip worth a grand through the gap. Christ Air should do the trick.</p><p>*Team park list<br>2500 point tweak grab<br>Do a body flip<br>720 one foot off the half wall<br>Gap into the mega drop<br>Do a 360 christ air<br>540 the gap<br>Transfer over the cut-out<br>Do a rocket air<br>Dark-catch for 1.5 seconds<br>Full loop the half-pipe</p><p>Ten whole minutes for this one. For the most part these are easy, you just have to know where to go. You've got so much time, so don't worry. Gap to the mega drop first, then go the other route Then go the other way again. Then a final time to loop the pipe.</p><p>The 'Burb-a-tron:</p><p>*Dude, wash your feet<br>Here's one with a twist. Only tricks that are one or no footed count. Meanwhile you've got to collect ten thousand points within two minutes. Easy seeing as one and no foot grabs net you the most points anyway. As long as you know how to pump, it's easy. Though personally I prefer the pool off to the left. If you're having difficulty hit up easy mode for the top speeds.</p><p>*To the streets<br>Gap the grass to the street<br>Grass gap to sidewalk<br>Land the final grass gap</p><p>An entire 90 seconds for something easily done in a third of that time.</p><p>*Sidewalk steps<br>Three stair sets to gap across in 90 seconds. You've got so much time, take it easy and set up properly.</p><p>*Six sick stoops<br>You need to either grind or manny each of the six stoops within 90 seconds to beat this goal.</p><p>*Crusin' in manual<br>Manual through the gates<br>Manual for 152 metres</p><p>The challenge gives you a minute which is roughly the time you need. Just watch for the cars and hold your manny and you should be fine. Don't worry, you can bail out at that first lane switch and still get the distance.</p><p>*Hippy tournament<br>90 seconds to hippy jump (X+A) the eleven hurdles. Just crouch long enough and it should be easy.</p><p>*Hedge hop</p><p>You need to do any sort of one foot air over the hedge inside of 45 seconds. Ollie north for major style though.</p><p>*Carvatron list<br>Handplant the top of the corner<br>Grind the wavy ledge<br>Gap the hip<br>360 flip a boob<br>Manual between the arrows<br>Transfer the tall spine<br>600 point trick down the short stairs<br>1500 point trick in the pocket<br>Grind the ledge<br>Footplant the kinked rail</p><p>I'd recommend not wasting time, you've only got five, so switch to easy to kill the pumping. Once that's out of the way it's easy.</p><p>*Pool of tricks<br>Tweak a 540 grab<br>Get on the roof<br>One-foot air trick off the small hip<br>Handplant the loveseat channel<br>Grind over the light<br>Gap love seat channel<br>2500 point air trick<br>Handplant the roof<br>Do a 720 spin<br>Transfer the large hip</p><p>Don't even try it. Switch to easy mode. You've got five minutes and that isn't enough in hardcore unless you're pro. Some people have issues handplanting the roof. As long as you get there with speed and hold RB just as you're leaving the bowl, you should plant it. As for transferring the large hip. Don't ollie. For the 720, spin as much as you can and try adding some more by letting go of your grab and holding the right stick in the same direction as the left. If you have issues with the points, just build up a x3 multiplier first.</p><p>Maloof Money Cup:</p><p>This actually needs to be unlocked by beating the Maloof contests first.</p><p>*Money on the bank<br>You need to get ten thousand points within two minutes. You can only trick on the bank and weird tile pyramid grind thing.</p><p>*The mooney loop<br>Gap the doorway<br>Make the box gap<br>Clear the stairs</p><p>Ninety seconds for a very simple task. Don't worry, it's a piece of cake.</p><p>*The cup circuit<br>Gap the doorway<br>Manual the square pad<br>Trick onto the fun box<br>Hippy jump the rail into the bank</p><p>This doesn't have to be done in a line and I'd advise not to. You've got ninety seconds, so don't worry. I did everything except the manny pad, I just completely miss it every time and just go back.</p><p>*More than a gap<br>Gap to the brick bank<br>Gap the red picnic table</p><p>A minute for this one is forty seconds wasted. There is absolutely no difficulty to this.</p><p>*Bank in black<br>Sixty seconds to hit six black spots. They're arranged in a line, more or less, so you shouldn't have any difficulties.</p><p>*Red is dead<br>Sixty seconds to hit six bred spots. Again, a line. No difficulties here.</p><p>*Yes, you can grind it<br>Three minutes for a 450 point grind. Now this is the actual grind points, so flipping in and out doesn't count. A ten metre tailslide should do it.</p><p>*Maloof money tweak<br>You've got ninety seconds to clear the air with a tweaked grab and land in a grind on the rail. First try stuff.</p><p>*Maloof vert list<br>Grind the rail<br>Do a body flip<br>Do a one-foot 540<br>Handplant a rail<br>Air over the arch<br>Fingerflip 180 the gap<br>Grind across the arch<br>Grind the red extension<br>Do a 540 Christ air<br>5000 point trick</p><p>Four minutes for this list. Most of these are easy and can be done at once. For instance a 540 one foot to the rail. If you have issues handplanting the rails, move them close to the edge. You don't need to fully grind the arch, just about half way and stick it. For the 5000 point trick I recommend resetting, then doing some sort of trick before the roll of the ramp so you get at least an x2 multiplier. From there, body spin and flip to grab and land in a grind possibly flipping out for it.</p><p>I don't take credit for the lot's descriptions.
