While we are quite knowledgable&nbsp;on how internet history, page caching and cookies work, most of the world thinks that what they do online isn’t really linked to them in anyway. With&nbsp;most&nbsp;of the world being oblivious to the different types of online and mobile tracking tools and software&nbsp;that are out there, this leaves a huge opportunity for any affiliates, bloggers&nbsp;and online marketers to cash in and&nbsp;take advantage of the situation.</p><p>A good example of this can be seen through the recent <a href=#>Ashley Madison</a> data leak. With millions of people going online to see if their loved one created an account on their site, there is now a missing trust factor that was once there. Now the question is, what are people actively thinking about when others are online? (and what if they could actually see what they were searching for online)</p><p>All of this is leading up&nbsp;to millions of people going online and looking for software that can report keyboard logging and monitor internet usage.&nbsp;This type of software isn’t just for people that are worried about trust issues, it’s also for parents that want to monitor their kid’s internet usage&nbsp;and even businesses that want to make sure their employees are actually spending their time on work.</p><p>Another big concern is how families might be using their mobile devices… whether it be going to inappropriate sites, contacting people they shouldn’t be or even for keeping an eye on where you kid is going on a daily basis — it’s now all possible through advanced online monitoring software.</p><p>Before jumping into the concept of how you can make money with such a service, let’s take a look at <a href=# rel=noopener>mSpy monitoring software</a> and how it works.</p><h2>mSpy Advanced Desktop and Cell Phone Monitoring</h2><p>As described through the scenarios above, mSpy has created a software solution that allows you monitor desktop and cell phone usage across multiple platforms. What’s also important to note is that this software isn’t just being used to track internet usage among the family or for parents, it’s also being used to keep workers more productive while online as well.</p><p>Check out the short 30-second video below to see how mSpy works.</p><p>Here are just a few of the features and benefits to using mSpy monitoring software.</p><ul><li>WhatsApp, SMS, call logs, location tracking & 25 more features</li><li>Compatible with Android, iOS, Windows and Mac OS</li><li>Easily accessible from any browser</li><li>24/7 multi-language support</li><li>5 Minute Installation</li></ul><p>In the screenshot below you will see what it looks like when you are logged into the dashboard area. On the left hand side you will see all of the different monitoring features that are built into the desktop monitoring service, while also seeing the “Keylogger” details in the main area.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mSpy_-_Keylogger.png alt=mSpy_-_Keylogger width=675 height=422 sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A preview of the mobile monitoring service can also be seen below. Notice the many different data points and area that are being tracked, especially the “10 Most Calling Contacts”, “Recent Cell Phone Activity” and “Locations” — all of which are powerful assets when trying to keep your children safe at all times.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mSpy_-_Son_Kevin_Mobile_Device.png alt=mSpy_-_Son_Kevin_Mobile_Device width=675 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>For more on mSpy and their software, you can visit their main site at <a href=# rel=noopener>https://mspy.com</a> — however, now it’s time for use to dive into the affiliate marketing opportunity that lies within this software as well!</p><h3>How to Make Money with mSpy Monitoring Software</h3><p>Like many services and software solutions, mSpy has an affiliate program that allows you to promote their site and earn a nice commission on all referred sales.&nbsp;Besides the obvious advantage of earning money by recommending a solution to something people are already&nbsp;looking for, affiliates of mSpy also a have the following advantages.</p><ul><li><strong>$95.5 average sale</strong> (mSpy knows their audience well and exactly what they want, which leads to a higher sales average and more earnings for your site)</li><li><strong>120 days cookie life</strong> (affiliate programs with 100+ day cookies allows you to earn money should the user come back to the site in the future and complete their purchase)</li><li><strong>1.5% average refund rate</strong> (with a very low refund rate, you won’t be surprised at the end of the month with many order refunds to lower your total commissions)</li><li><strong>200+ promo tools</strong> (banners, text, ad copy — mSpy has you covered with all of their top performing ad copy and custom creatives)</li><li><strong>Real-time Statistics</strong> (don’t you hate waiting around for your affiliate stats to lag behind your traffic and click stats? mSpy has real time affiliate stats)</li><li><strong>Weekly Payments</strong> (forget about&nbsp;waiting til the end of the month to get, mSpy pays out to their affiliates on a weekly basis)</li><li><strong>Dedicated Support</strong> (with affiliate marketing a main focus for mSpy, they also have a full dedicated support team to help with your promotions.</li></ul><p><strong>TIP:</strong> As mentioned above, mSpy also offers “cell phone monitoring”, which is an extremely lucrative niche that has little saturation at this point. Any affiliate marketers who establish their presence in this area can keep making money for years to come and mobile continues to grow.</p><p>In addition to everything mentioned above, each affiliate is also given access to their own affiliate manager who can answer any questions you might have, create original ad creative for you and also give you new ideas for how to best promote mSpy.</p><h3>Earn up to 70% Commission per Sale</h3><p>Another benefit to the mSpy affiliate program is that you can earn up to 70% commission per sale with the right amount of volume. Something affiliates always have to struggle with, is the concept of sending their high quality leads and customers to a company and only getting a fraction of the cost. With mSpy and a 70% payout, you are going to be stressed to find a higher paying product with anywhere near the same quality, brand and services in place.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Affiliate_Program_mSpy.png alt=Affiliate_Program_mSpy width=675 height=267 sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>To join the mSpy affiliate program, you can go to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>https://www.mspy.com/affiliates.html</a></p><p><strong>As for promotion of the mSpy software, you have a lot of options.</strong></p><p>With the Ashley Madison hack still gaining a lot of attention and our privacy being put at risk everyday, there are many ways you could be creating content around people who are actively searching for keylogging and internet monitoring&nbsp;software — while both addressing the issue of why it’s important, how to set it up and why mSpy is the best software to get the job done.</p><p>Through the use of <a href=# rel=noopener>Keyword Planner</a> we can see a wide variation of monitoring and tracking based keywords that people are actively searching for on a daily basis. Everything from “cell phone tracking” to “spy mobile” and of course everything relating to “desktop monitoring” and internet usage as well.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Online_Monitoring_Software.png alt=Online_Monitoring_Software width=512 height=424 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This type of marketing and targeting could be done through search marketing and also by creating your own content, while also becoming an authority site in the process. We already know that someone becomes a new parent every day and that millions of kids are getting their first phone every day as well — all of this leading to new parents going online to find information on how to track, monitor and protect their families at the same time.</p><p>Should you put in the time and effort to build out your own resource site catering to this audience, you could see a steady steam of visitors and mSpy referral sales coming in on a daily basis!</p><p>Want a couple more ideas? Creating mspy software review articles (or sites) and videos is another great way to drive sales for this product. Lots of affiliates are already doing this and it’s simply a matter of you taking action to get your own slice of the earnings pie.</p><p>Want one last&nbsp;knowledge bomb for how to effectively promote mSpy? Of course you do!</p><p>Don’t forget about the power of Facebook Ads and their superior demographic targeting. Want to hit “Parents” with pre-teens and teenagers… consider it done in just a few clicks. (Tip: When using Facebook Ads, I highly recommend <a href=#>building out your own landing pages</a> to target the right audience, cater your message/ad copy&nbsp;the best way possible and to also make the FB Ads approval process as seamless as possible.)<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Facebook_Ads_Parent_Targeting.png alt=Facebook_Ads_Parent_Targeting width=675 height=489 sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>I only scratched the surface on&nbsp;different ways you can promote mSpy&nbsp;monitoring software, now it’s time for you to <a href=# rel=noopener>join their affiliate program</a> and put these ideas and concepts into action.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunC0zrBkraddoq6ssYympqedqWK9s7vMqKuippdiurC6yK2mq6GenHq0u8WtrpqqlWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
