A few months back, the two were spotted together in New York. According to sources, the pair was out for dinner. "Selena and Zayn went out in SoHo in New York City last night at around 10:30 pm," the source claimed. "They walked in holding hands and were kissing. Most restaurant staff and restaurant goers didn't notice them. It seemed like they were comfortable together and it was clear that it was a date."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/selena_gomez_pink.jpg><h2 id=selena-was-apparently-linked-with-another-singer>Selena Was Apparently Linked With Another Singer</h2><p>The rumors of Selena and Zayn's romance started when a TikTok user shared a screenshot of her conversation with a friend. She claimed that the pair walked into the restaurant where she worked. She also claimed that she was the one who seated her, while they were getting cosy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Zayn isn't the only one linked to the Wolves singer. Before Zayn, Selena was allegedly going out with The Chainsmokers' Drew Taggart. Rumors started to spread after a source claimed the two were a thing. But, Selena was quick to shoot the speculations down. She posted a story on Instagram confirming she "like being alone too much," with the hashtag "#iamsingle."</p><h2 id=zayn-malik-admires-selena-and-would-love-to-date-her>Zayn Malik Admires Selena And Would Love To Date Her</h2><p>Although Selena has claimed that she is still single, Zayn seems to be very much interested in taking things further with her. A source revealed Zayn has always admired Selena and thinks she is an "incredible person, inside and out."</p><p>The source also claimed that Zayn has been "focused on himself these past few years and feels like he’s ready to date again." "He’s feeling optimistic about the possibility of things growing between him and Selena but isn’t putting any pressure on the situation. He’d rather just let things progress organically and believes she feels the same."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>One Direction Fans Haven't Forgotten That Time Selena Gomez Was Caught With With Niall Horan</a></span></p><p>However, the two weren't serious about a relationship and wanted to take things slow. While Zayn hopes he gets to spend more time with Selena, the Lose You to Love Me singer appears to be open to seeing other people. Selena has dated a few, including The Weeknd, after her very public split from Justin Bieber in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnqSVo65us86mnLNlo567qLjEZqCnZaSeuLW7ymatopyVpHqiucidZLOZqaN6rq3LoqJmnJGptq%2BzjKuspqeiqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
