Dalma began to play tennis when she was five years old. Near our house, her father had two tennis courts, where she spent most of her childhood.</p><p>Dalma learned to play from him. She enjoyed the game in all of its components. When Dalma was six years old, she participated in my first tournament and narrowly lost in the final. But it was a fantastic experience. She had no other goals but to compete in future competitions and win. I’m still motivated by the same thing today.</p><p>Dalma enjoys spending time on the court, growing as a player daily, and watching her efforts pay off. When you reflect, you realize that you gave it your all and thoroughly enjoyed yourself.</p><p>She claims that winning the US Open Singles championship in 2015 was the pinnacle of her junior tennis career.
