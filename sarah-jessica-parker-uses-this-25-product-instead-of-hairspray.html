Dry shampoo has become one of the more popular products to use — not to mention the wide range of texturizing sprays available on the market.</p><p>But we’re looking to the A-list for our latest inspiration — in fact, we recently caught wind of a different product that may be able to take the place of dry shampoo or hairspray. The suggestion comes courtesy from none other than <strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong>! Considering we’ve never seen her have a bad hair day, we were intrigued — and you should be too. The And Just Like That… star is reportedly a massive fan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">of a specific spray</a> that can do it all!</p><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Serge Normant Dream Big Instant Volumizing Spray</a> with free shipping for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$25</a>, available at Amazon!

She also claims you can “use it instead of dry shampoo or hairspray to give your hair more body.”</span></p><p><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This product</a> is designed to give your hair a boost of volume in the same way that dry shampoo can, but what makes this spray different is that it dries clear — making it virtually invisible. Many other products tend to leave a white residue that we all want to avoid. That’s one of the reasons we’re guessing SJP implies this is a universal hit!&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Serge Normant Dream Big Instant Volumizing Spray</a> with free shipping for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$25</a>, available at Amazon!

If you have a specific style that you want to keep in place, be it curls or a blowout, this product may also give your hair touchable hold that lasts throughout the day!</p><p>Shoppers say that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this product</a> works particularly well for fine hair that’s in need of some extra volume. Even though it’s a bit on the pricer side for a hairspray, reviewers note that it’s seriously worth every penny! You can use it all over the head or just spray a little bit on your roots to give your locks some extra lift.
