This set of three tanks comes from one of our favorite athleisure brands, known for their seamless, sculpting workout sets. This bodysuit is made from a very similar blend of materials, including 10% Spandex for the stretch that snatches our shape. These tops aren’t just top-rated on Amazon — they’ve also gone viral on TikTok!</p><p>Unlike regular T-shirts and tanks that bunch up around your waist, this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">form-fitting one-piece</a> stays taut for a smooth appearance (never sloppy!). And the ribbed fabric takes this bodysuit from plain to polished. We would totally wear this top out on the town with high-waisted jeans or leather pants.</p><p>Similar styles retail for two to three times as much — for one individual shirt!
