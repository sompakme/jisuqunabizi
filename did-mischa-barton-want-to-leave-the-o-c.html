Rachel Bilson had her daughter, Briar Rose, in 2014, and Adam Brody and his wife Leighton Meester have two children.</p><p>Since leaving&nbsp;The O.C., Mischa Barton <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">competed on Dancing With The Stars</a>&nbsp;and has acted in some movies.

According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, she said,&nbsp;“I just had a lot in my career that I wanted to do and accomplish. I felt like things were really heavily reliant upon me, and I was getting no time to do any of the other offers that were out there.”</p><p>Barton also said that while the writers could have kept Marissa alive, she thought that her character should definitely have a dark and tragic end. She explained, "I just don’t think sailing off into the sunset’s the proper goodbye. She’s one of those burnout characters where I don’t know how much more we could have done with her anyway," according to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Rachel Bilson Has Said About A ‘Hart Of Dixie’ Revival</a></span></p><h2 id=for-the-show>For The Show?</h2><p>Creator Josh Schwartz called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marissa's passing away a "creative decision."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an&nbsp;interview with&nbsp;The Huffington Post, he explained,&nbsp;"It was a hundred percent a creative decision for the show and it was born out of both feeling creatively like it was the direction the show needed to head and also, quite frankly, a function of needing to do something big to shake up the show at the end of that third season to both get the show to come back for a fourth season and, I think, to give the show a real creative jolt in Season 4 and move the show in its own surprising, unexpected direction."</p><p>Schwartz also said that Mischa Barton did a wonderful job portraying her character: he said, "But Mischa showed up every day and did her job and did a great job and worked really hard so it had nothing to do with her."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To ‘O.C.’ Star Willa Holland</a></span></p><p>Fans will remember that when Marissa Cooper died, she and Ryan were driving in a car, and Kevin Volchok was right there, chasing them.

According to&nbsp;ABC News Go, Barton taped an interview&nbsp;while she was&nbsp;competing on&nbsp;Dancing With The Stars&nbsp;and talked about this time in her life.</p><p>The actress said about&nbsp;saying goodbye to Marissa, "I&nbsp;think I just got to the point where I was like, 'I'm not sure I'm enjoying this anymore.' I just felt like I was in a machine and I couldn't really get off. So it was time to step back. So I went back to England and it was just a year of real self-exploration.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Us Weekly, Barton is from England and was born in Hammersmith, the UK, so it made sense for her to want to move back there.</p><p>In 2008, Mischa Barton was interviewed by&nbsp;Marie Claire UK&nbsp;and shared that finding some time to be a regular person was important to her. She said, "I’m not really sure what people’s preconceived notions are. I don’t look at the gossip websites – it’s unhealthy and I think it’s a large part of what drives people in LA crazy. I’m an actress, I’m in this to find the next great project. The fact is, I’m having a real-life and being a normal human being."</p><p>It's&nbsp;interesting to hear the different reasons why Mischa Barton left&nbsp;The O.C.&nbsp;before the fourth season, and&nbsp;it sounds like it worked out since Barton was able to live her life out of the limelight for a&nbsp;little while.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of MTV’s ‘The Hills’: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdora0r8eaZJuZoqm8r3nWmqWtZaSkeq2xwK%2BcZqyYmnqwecJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
