It caused her to cancel multiple tours. She also struggled with opioid addiction after her doctor gave her a prescription for the pain. On top of that, her family has a history of heart issues. Elvis Presley, as well as his dad, <a href=#>died from heart attacks</a>. "Preliminary autopsy findings" ruled out "cardiac arrhythmia" as the <a href=#>King of Rock and Roll</a>'s cause of death, per Dr. Jerry Francisco, the Shelby County coroner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Lisa's mother, Priscilla</a> was the first to break the news of Lisa's passing.

The two quickly hit it off. After the death of <a href=#>Lisa's ex-husband, Michael Jackson</a> that year, Sarah offered her Marbella Mansion to the Lights Out hitmaker, so she could grieve away from the press.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They grew closer the next year when Lisa and <a href=#>her then-husband, Michael Lockwood</a> moved to England.

"It was when she first moved to the village about two years ago," said the owner, Kim Scales. "She is really interested in who people are and wanted to know all about our lives and how we live."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fono3pyxwaelnen.jpeg><p>He continued: "We own the pub and a mobile fish and chip van, but she said she'd never heard of anything like it, and said she wanted to work on it. She got on there with her son, but we were all laughing because not one of the locals realized who it was."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa and Sarah's friendship continued even when the former moved back to the US.

"We look at Priscilla as a mother to Lisa Marie, we look at Lisa Marie and say, 'You lost a son,'" she said of <a href=#>Lisa's son, Benjamin who died in 2020</a>. "Mothers losing children — there are no words for it. So today we talk about action.
