While we know and love her for her music, that's not the only thing JoJo has gotten up to. The star began acting at a young age and has appeared in countless films, allowing her to amass quite the impressive net worth. Here's everything we know about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JoJo's rise to fame!</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Demi Lovato Tells Jojo 'She's Waited Her Entire Career' To Sing With Her</a></span></p><h2 id=jojo-s-rise-to-fame>JoJo's Rise To Fame</h2><p>JoJo has been a respected member of the entertainment industry ever since she was signed at 12 years old! The singer signed with Blackground Records and released her first studio album, "JoJo" in 2004. JoJo instantly blew up and her vocals were instantly recognized as some of the best from an up and coming artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By her second album, "The High Road" which featured songs such as "Too Little Too Late" and "This Time", JoJo began to be referred to as a young Mariah Carey. Luckily, this was taken as a compliment for both artists, and behold, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimi and JoJo performed backstage together</a> earlier this year!</p><p>While her music career took off brilliantly, with millions of sales, JoJo began to explore acting as well. The star appeared in "Aquamarine" alongside Emma Roberts and Sara Paxton. The 2006 flick was all any kid or teen could talk about at the time, but her work on-screen didn't stop there. JoJo also appeared in the hilarious film "RV", which also starred the legendary, Robin Williams. With two hit albums and films under her belt, it's safe to say that JoJo was doing very well for herself.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Jojo Didn't Let Anyone Get In The Way Of Her Creativity, Not Even A Boyfriend!</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans anxiously awaited for JoJo's third studio album, they would be waiting for quite a long time. JoJo released "Mad Love" in 2016 after a nearly decade-long battle with her record label. After wanting to leave her label, JoJo was not only stuck but had no rights to any of her material, including her own voice. Considering Blackground Records legally owned her voice and actively prevented Jojo from releasing new music, she was left with no other choice but to sue. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The legal battle took years to complete</a>,&nbsp;however, luckily for JoJo, she prevailed!</p><p>Despite getting her freedom, JoJo made no money during these long and dreadful years. The star revealed she was paid absolutely nothing and received no compensation for damages from her former label. At this point, JoJo was living off of the money she had earned from her two previous albums and films. While this may not seem like a lot, it certainly allowed her to get back into the game and make new music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, JoJo released "Mad Love", her third studio album with Atlantic Records. The singer sold nearly 100,000 units in the United States alone and embarked on her first tour in over a decade. While she has certainly been through it all, JoJo is determined to reach the top spot, yet again. With now four albums to her name, a successful tour, and her past work, JoJo is back and better than ever.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Jojo Recounts Holding Her Family Accountable Over Racial Injustices</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmqqKml5q%2FbrbOo6ZmmZ2WwLSxw2afnqpdbHqutculoKimXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
