After graduating from the University of Florida with a telecommunications degree in 2000 and starting her career as a freelance reporter with Fox Sports Florida, Andrews quickly moved through the sports reporting ranks and began working for ESPN in 2004. She made her debut as a reporter for the network’s national hockey league coverage and later offered commentary for ESPN’s College Football Thursday and Saturday Primetime telecasts. She also provided Big Ten college basketball coverage and Major League Baseball sideline reporting.</p><p>In June 2012, Andrews left ESPN to join Fox Sports, where she was the first host of Fox College Football’s studio show and is a field reporter for most major sporting events on Fox. In 2014, she replaced Pam Oliver as the sideline reporter on the lead crew for Fox NFL.</p><p>Andrews competed on the tenth season of ABC’s <i>Dancing With the Stars </i>with professional partner <b><a href=#>Maksim Chmerkovskiy</a></b>; they placed third out of 11 couples. She became cohost of the show in 2014.</p><p>The sportscaster has been open about the emotional trauma she went through as the victim of a stalking incident, in which a man filmed her nude without her consent through a hotel peephole and posted the nude videos online in 2009. The man responsible, Michael David Barrett, was charged with interstate stalking and taking and posting the videos. Barrett was sentenced to 30 months in prison and released in July 2012. In March 2016, Andrews was awarded $55 million in her civil lawsuit against Barrett and the Nashville Marriott hotel.</p><p>Andrews is currently in a relationship with NHL hockey player <b><a href=#>Jarret Stoll</a></b>, and the couple moved in together in 2015 after dating for three years.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnlae2r3nAp5urnaeofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
