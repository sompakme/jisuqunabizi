The 1980’s were the height of the supermodel era, but a lot has changed since the time of <a href=#>Cindy Crawford</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Christie Brinkley</a>. Although there have been some models that have been able to reach iconic supermodel status throughout the years, the change that has occurred in the modeling industry is undeniable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gone are the days where magazines and ad campaigns only sought out models for their photo shoots, and more often than not, the most notable jobs nowadays are given to movie stars and other celebrities. With <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston </a>and <a href=#>Cameron Diaz </a>being more sought after than those that are strictly in the modeling agency, it can be difficult for up-and-coming models to make their impact on the world. <a href=#>Kate Upton</a> has been able to break the mold in this in a way that has been truly different than others in her field.</p><p>Not only has she been able to "bust" into the modeling industry despite the fact that she doesn’t have the typical model body, but she has broken the Internet on a number of occasions with the frenzy that surrounds some of her photos and videos. Proving that sometimes the most appealing aspects of a woman revolve around her personality, some of her videos depicting the most flamboyant parts of her personality just helped to amp up her sex appeal. Check out 15 times that Kate Upton broke the Internet, and see how the world has been captivated by this buxom beauty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-kate-upton-rejects-reporter-on-live-tv><strong>15. Kate Upton Rejects Reporter On Live TV</strong></h2><p>In 2012, Kate Upton was at the peak of her modeling career and could be seen on a number of different television shows and talk shows. With her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition making a huge splash, it wasn’t surprising that she would be asked to be on CNBC Sports. Yet, the surprising part happened when she seemed to be ogled by the very-married CNBC Sports reporter, Darren Rovell. Getting down on one knee and presenting Upton a rose, Rovell actually asked Upton to be his Valentine on live television. Upton promptly rejected him saying, “I definitely want the chocolate, but there’s a little bit of a waiting list.” Rovell responded with, “Thank you so much,” and then he turned to the camera and said, “Courtney, I love you baby.” It was such a cringe-worthy moment, especially after the female anchor felt the need to point out that Rovell’s wife, Courtney, was pregnant with their child at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-carl-s-jr-burger-ad-with-kate-upton><strong>14. Carl’s Jr. Burger Ad With Kate Upton</strong></h2><p>Carl’s Jr., which is under the parent company of Hardee’s, first started their campaign featuring an ultra provocative take on eating fast food in 2005 when they featured <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>. Yet, the campaign took on a life of its own, with a great relationship with their reigning director, Chris Applebaum. The campaign has starred some of the hottest women in the entertainment industry including <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, <a href=#>Padma Lakshmi</a>, and <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a>. Yet, it was Kate Upton’s drive-in themed Carl’s Jr. commercial that still remains one of the most popular advertisements for the fast food chain. Advertising the Carl’s Jr. Southwest Patty Melt, some criticized the commercial for being too highly sexualized. Yet, Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s CEO gave an explanation of their goal saying they “need to be able to eat the burger like you’re loving it. You really have to go at it. You really have to attack it.” The video definitely showed Upton going at it, and many have claimed it the sexiest ad for the fast food restaurant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-2012-sports-illustrated-cover><strong>13. 2012 Sports Illustrated Cover</strong></h2><p>When Kate Upton landed the Carl’s Jr. commercial ad campaign in 2012, she hadn’t yet reached her full potential for mainstream fame. While her star was definitely on the rise, it seemed like extraordinary timing in the fast food chain picking her to endorse the Carl’s Jr. Southwest Patty Melt. CEO, Andy Puzder, was quick to recognize the fortunate timing of their model choice when he was quoted by the Associated Press as saying, “We have a history of picking these young women before they hit their peak. We put Kate Upton in a month before she got the cover of Sports Illustrated.” So, before Upton was featured on the cover of the 2012 Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated, there was already quite a buzz surrounding this buxom beauty. Once the issue was released, people saw a bit more than what was already "referenced"&nbsp;in&nbsp;her Carl’s Jr. commercial. Wearing an itsy-bitsy string bikini, the transitioning tone of the swimsuit wasn’t the only feature that helped Upton stand out on the cover. Proving she could hold her own on such an iconic platform, the release of the cover image created a frenzy that only helped to propel her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-game-of-war-advertisements><strong>12. Game Of War Advertisements</strong></h2><p>Although the original Game of War mobile game was released in 2010, the world of ever-evolving apps and games has created a need for a revamped version. In 2013, it was relaunched as Game of War: Fire Age, but it wasn’t until Kate Upton was hired as the spokesperson in the advertisements that the game truly exploded. At one point, the mobile game was bringing in an astounding $1 million per day, and one look at Upton’s ads can make the influx in revenue a bit more understandable. With a $40 million ad budget, Upton is portrayed as Athena, Greek Goddess of war, in the television advertisements, as well as within the game. The television advertisements played out more like a trailer to the next Lord of the Rings, complete with computer generated monsters. The ad campaign involved a series of different Kate Upton portrayals, but the most buzz-worthy occurred during the 2015 Super Bowl. Showing Upton in a bathtub, riding a horse, and battling her enemies; it was no wonder it resonated so well with fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-upton-s-new-hot-bff><strong>11. Upton’s New Hot BFF</strong></h2><p>The only thing better than photos of Kate Upton are photos with Kate Upton and her new hot brunette BFF. Alexandra Daddario had quickly made a name for herself when she appeared topless in the hit HBO series, True Detective, so it didn’t seem surprising that fans would start seeing her on the silver screen. The surprising part came when she seemed to have such a close relationship with Kate Upton. While filming in Vancouver, Upton and Daddario formed a friendship that was documented each step of the way via social media sites like Instagram. Upton showed that she wasn’t a mean girl hoping to maintain her “fairest of the land” status, and instead she embraced her brunette costar with open arms. The Internet became frenzied over their friendship, and it helped to form a more rounded public persona of the blonde bombshell. Similar reports of Upton’s kind nature towards other beautiful women in the industry came out during the taping of The Other Woman featuring <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a>, so this was just a great continuation to keep fans enthralled with this buxom beauty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-beach-bunny-runway-show-featuring-kate-upton><strong>10. Beach Bunny Runway Show Featuring Kate Upton</strong></h2><p>In July 2011, the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week runway shows were held at The Raleigh to showcase the Swim 2012 collection. With the show entitled the Beach Bunny Swimwear show, Kate Upton definitely embodied the beautiful and sexy beach bunny anyone would appreciate. Early on in her modeling career, it would have been a boost to any model’s career to be showcased in a runway show for the hottest swimsuits in fashion. Yet the biggest feature to her appearance was the fact that Upton didn’t look like the typical swimsuit model seen on the runway. Never apologetic for her curves, Upton appeared confident and sexy in a way that helped open the minds of viewers. Proving that not all swimsuit models are required to be toothpick thin, Upton sent the world in a frenzy that probably helped land her some of her most coveted roles onscreen and on the covers of the hottest magazines around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-kate-upton-frolics-with-babies-and-unicorns><strong>9. Kate Upton Frolics With Babies And Unicorns</strong></h2><p>Carine Rotifeld's “Hush Little Baby Don't You Cry” video became a huge sensation in 2012, especially since Kate embodied a fairy tale look that had a much different theme than some of her other iconic looks. Posing alongside babies, puppies, and animals, Upton’s ensembles seemed like such a stark contrast against this ultra innocent backdrop. Yet, the irony of the ensembles seemed to remind fans of sexy Bo Peep costumes worn during Halloween, so it definitely made a lasting impression on viewers. From the ruffled dresses to rolling around in the grass, people loved the idea of Upton as a mythical creature alongside her handsome man dressed as a unicorn. With Upton’s beauty taking on a mystical undertone, the shoot didn’t seem too far off from reality. Rotifield addressed her reasoning behind choosing Upton as the model for her new magazine, CF Fashion Book, by saying, “I didn’t want a normal model. I wanted someone with a sensual body, someone who could be a mother for all these babies.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-zero-gravity-photo-shoot><strong>8. Zero Gravity Photo Shoot</strong></h2><p>For the 2014 Swimsuit Issue for Sports Illustrated magazine, Kate Upton wasn’t chosen for the cover but her presence was definitely felt. In a first-ever zero gravity photo shoot with a swimsuit model, Upton boarded G-Force One, a modified Boeing 727 from the ZERO-G Corporation, to shoot a pictorial spread for Sports Illustrated. Photographer James Macari had the privilege of shooting Upton in a weightless state in a pictorial spread that was four years in the making. The spread required a number of people within the cramped Boeing 727, and the process went through its fair share of bumps – literally. A behind-the-scenes video of the photo shoot was released, which showed everyone bumping into the walls in the plane in pursuit of obtaining the perfect shot. While it would be hard enough for a photographer to get some professional looking pictures while bouncing off the walls, it would seem even more difficult for a model to look perfectly sexy while floating through a zero gravity space. Yet, Upton did it with ease, and the release of the photos and video were met with resounding acceptance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-sobe-staring-contest-with-kate-upton><strong>7. SoBe Staring Contest With Kate Upton</strong></h2><p>In an effort to cater towards their male demographic, SoBe created a project that was meant to be for their “Try Everything” platform. Hoping to gain more of a male audience, Kate Upton was brought on to try to get men to try their product. In 2011 SoBe threw a party to enhance the experience of the staring contest with a digital audience. Unlike the rules of a typical staring contest, competitors were under the scrutiny of face detection software to determine the eye alignment of the user. The goal of the contest was for competitors to maintain eye contact, and not look down at any of the other areas of her body. The kicker of the contest was the fact that Upton was wearing an itty-bitty bikini, and she seemed to constantly strike a sexy pose throughout the contest. While it would be difficult enough to refrain from sneaking a peek at Upton’s cleavage, the mission became ultimately impossible with her pushing her breasts together or lightly lining the edge of her swimsuit with the tip of her fingers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-kate-upton-s-easter-video><strong>6. Kate Upton’s Easter Video</strong></h2><p>LOVE magazine had a series of photo spreads during the Easter season in 2012, with many feeling it became a bit of a competition between<a href=#> Doutzen Kroes</a> and Kate Upton. While everyone seemed to enjoy Kroes in a Jessica Rabbit-style theme, it didn’t seem to compare to Upton’s rendition of a sexy Peter Cottontail. Although the whole bunny ears and cottontail outfit has been done before, not everyone can exude the same sex appeal as Kate Upton. From wiping her hands on her skimpy white bra to rolling around in Easter basket straw, the whole video just screamed sexy. The see-thru panties seemed to only be enhanced by her bushy tail, and even all the quirky nuances added to the appeal. After posting the video through her social media, many fans couldn’t help but wish they were one of the eggs shoved into her top through her playful little rabbit rendition. While she may not have been as glamorous as Jessica Rabbit, she definitely didn’t seem to skimp on the sex appeal as a furry white bunny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-photos-released-of-topless-horse-shot-for-complex-magazine><strong>5. Photos Released Of Topless Horse Shot For Complex Magazine</strong></h2><p>The first issue of Complex magazine was released in 2002, as a bi-monthly magazine ranging on everything from fashion to music and art. When Kate Upton was asked to appear in the pages of Complex magazine in 2012, she had already donned numerous covers and pictorial spreads. Whether it was the photographer’s idea to up the ante or it was Upton that wanted to push the boundaries of provocativeness, the goal was accomplished with her Complex photo shoot. To add to the hype on the spread, TMZ released a video offering a glimpse behind the scenes at the shoot. Entitled, “Kate Upton SUPER Topless On a Horse,” a frenzy occurred once fans saw this short video. For just 71&nbsp;seconds, the buzz created by the video might as well have been an entire movie for Upton. While she was indeed topless on a horse, it was TMZ’s decision to censor her breasts that caused the most controversy. It seems that not everyone had enough of Upton, and were outraged she was censored with stars covering her breasts in the video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-the-many-talents-of-kate-upton><strong>4. “The Many Talents Of Kate Upton”</strong></h2><p>Terry Richardson is a famed photographer that is a favorite for high profile GQ spreads, so he was the perfect option for the video segment entitled, “The Many Talents Of Kate Upton.” The video is a bit of a mash-up of different scenes involving Kate Upton, and was completely jam-packed with some of her hottest moments. Even though the clip was under two minutes, the video caused a huge sensation once it went viral. Presented by GQ, the video started off with Upton looking very Baywatch-esque as a lifeguard running on the beach. Obviously the “talents” listed weren’t exactly things that are only specific to Kate, but it gave a great excuse to watch her do some of the things she does best. Running on the beach may not be the most unique talent, but she sure did make it look like something special. The video went on to show some great carnival shots of her riding a roller coaster, shooting some hoops, and even going through a wardrobe malfunction on a ride. Yet, the best scene was at the very end, where her final talent was, “Wet T-Shirt Contest Champion.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-dancing-the-dougie-at-the-clippers-game><strong>3. Dancing the “Dougie” At The Clippers Game</strong></h2><p>Back when Kate Upton was still early on in her modeling career, she attended a Los Angeles Clippers game in 2011 and not even she could predict the frenzy that followed. At just 18-years-old, she and her model friend attended the Clippers game and seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely with the music playing over the loud speakers. Once the Cali Swag District song, “Teach Me How to Dougie,” began playing, Upton’s friend had the brilliant idea of recording her while she did the “Dougie.” Although she may have taken on the role of “teacher” in the video, she didn’t exactly come off as an expert of the “Dougie” dance. Instead, she came off as super-playful and sexy in a way that only Kate Upton could pull off. While models are often thought of as untouchable and glamorous, Upton’s “Dougie” video portrayed her as accessible and fun in a way that isn’t typical of a model.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-antarctica-swimsuit-shoot-gets-leaked><strong>2. Antarctica Swimsuit Shoot Gets Leaked</strong></h2><p>The cover for the Swimsuit Edition of Sports Illustrated magazine is more than just another photo shoot. The process of choosing the models for this particular specialty issue is heightened due to the iconic status of this cover. Previous models have been some of the most sought-after models in the industry, and some of the issues have become instantly recognizable. Although it should come as no surprise that Kate Upton would be chosen for their Swimsuit Edition for the 2013 cover, many pointed out how refreshing it was for the magazine to think outside of the box in their model choices. Yet, not only were fans thrilled by the magazine’s choice, but the photos became a firestorm when the cover was leaked online. There had already been so much buzz around her shoot, especially since the photo shoot was taken in December on the frozen Antarctic tundra. The cover was used for the 50th Anniversary of the iconic Swimsuit Edition, and fans couldn’t get enough of her semi-nude photos in the freezing cold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-dancing-the-cat-daddy-in-her-bikini><strong>1. Dancing The “Cat Daddy” In Her Bikini</strong></h2><p>In 2011, Kate Upton became an instant YouTube star when her video went viral. Shot by famed photographer, Terry Richardson, Upton wore a barely-there red bikini that could barely contain her. While the bikini was definitely in distress as she stood in front of the camera, things got even more interesting when she started dancing the “Cat Daddy.” Clearly, the video showed that Upton wasn’t your typical twig-shaped swimsuit model. Yet, her ultra feminine body was portrayed in such a sexy way, that it made her look far more appealing than some of those runway types the public has become so accustomed to. While her jiggling and writhing body was super-sexy in itself, another huge part of the appeal of the video was the fact that it showcased her personality. Seeming so down-to-earth and bubbly, the video captivated the world in a way that put all the other Instagram wannabe-hotties to shame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources: <a href=#>nydailynews</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>dailymail</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>boston</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmptXam2rrHSZqKarJViwrHAzqdkm6qfoLJuwMeeZKKmpJq%2Fr7HTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
