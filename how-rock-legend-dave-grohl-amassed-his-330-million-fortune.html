This not only has to do with his touring with the Foo Fighters, which makes the band more than $1,000,000 per show, but also the numerous projects outside the band that Grohl works on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For 2023, Grohl's net worth is $330 million.</p><p>This year and into 2024, the Foo Fighters have tour dates that are already sold out. As such, they are looking at quite a payday for their hours of entertaining fans on stage. Because of this, Grohl's fortune will only continue to grow, and if it is anything like years past, another $10 million should hit Grohl's bank account for 2024.</p><h2 id=dave-grohl-rose-to-fame-in-nirvana>Dave Grohl Rose To Fame In Nirvana</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dave-grohl-1.jpg><p>When looking at Grohl's time in the music industry and how he has been able to amass his fortune, there is simply no way that we can look past what he was able to achieve in Nirvana. The early 90s marked a massive shift from the music that dominated the radio in the 80s, and Nirvana helped usher in an entirely new era of music when they released Smells Like Teen Spirit back in 1991.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hair metal was on its way out, and the 90s was ready for a new sound. 1991 wound up causing a profound shift in the industry, and Nirvana was at the forefront of it all. Within the span of one month, Pearl Jam's Ten, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and Nirvana's Nevermind all hit shelves in record stores everywhere. In an instant, nothing was the same again.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Dave Grohl's Cruel Prank On A Stranger Tarnished His Reputation Of Being The Nicest Guy In Rock 'N' Roll</a></span></p><p>During his time in Nirvana, Grohl was the driving force behind the biggest band in the world, and their follow-up album, In Utero, would be the last before Kurt Cobain's untimely passing. Exact figures are unknown, but Nirvana's short time together was lucrative, and the band still generates millions from merch sales to this very day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being in one of the most important bands of all time is an incredible distinction to have, but instead of being content with that, Grohl wound up starting another band that has made him millions through the years.</p><h2 id=the-foo-fighters-have-made-dave-grohl-bank>The Foo Fighters Have Made Dave Grohl Bank</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dave-grohl-smiling.jpg><p>Just two years after Nirvana's In Utero, the Foo Fighters dropped their debut album, which was Dave Grohl basically doing everything himself. As time went on, Grohl recruited some exceptional musicians into the fold and turned the Foo Fighters into one of the most successful rock bands of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To date, the Foo Fighters have released 10 studio albums, 7 of which have been certified at least Platinum by the RIAA. Back in 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was estimated that the band had sold 30 million albums worldwide</a>, which is a staggering number. Album sales aren't what they used to be overall, but the band has continued to do well for themselves despite the shift in the industry.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>Dave Grohl Admitted To Jimmy Fallon That He Absolutely Refuses To Rehearse With The Foo Fighters</a></span></p><p>Not only has the band sold millions of records, but they have sold out the biggest venues around the world and have headlined major festivals all over the place. This has been a major revenue stream for the guys, and it has been a huge boost to Grohl's net worth through the years.</p><p>Nirvana and the Foo Fighters have made Grohl a rich man, but he has other ventures going on, as well.</p><h2 id=dave-grohl-has-gotten-into-other-areas-of-entertainment>Dave Grohl Has Gotten Into Other Areas Of Entertainment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dave-Grohl-on-Jimmy-Kimmel-Live.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the world of acting and directing, Grohl has gotten his feet wet, which has been fun for fans to see. Grohl usually appears as himself in projects, but he notably played the devil in Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. Grohl also appeared on The X-Files, and he lent his voice to Is It Fall Yet? back in 2000.</p><p>Grohl has worked behind the camera, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">serving as the director of Sound City</a>, which was a documentary about the history of the legendary music studio. The musician also produced the project, which was released back in 2013 and got some solid reviews from critics.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dave Grohl Once Performed A Classic Foo Fighters Song With Taylor Swift, But Nobody Will Ever Hear The Duet</a></span></p><p>Outside his major bands, Grohl has also helped out numerous artists in the studio and has had successful side projects. Grohl has worked with bands like Nine Inch Nails, The Queens of the Stone Age, Tenacious D, and Them Crooked Vultures. His body of work is extensive, and it proves just how valuable he is as a musician.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Grohl is a rock legend with nothing left to prove, but this won't stop him from making bangers until the day he hangs it up for good.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6VYrSzu8elZKedpGLEsL7ToWRsamBiuqq4y6Kmp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
