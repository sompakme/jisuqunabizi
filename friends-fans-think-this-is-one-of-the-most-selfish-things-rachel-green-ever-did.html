They continue to pick apart every character, relationship, and scene from the long-running sitcom in an effort to better understand what happened and&nbsp;why it happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of perhaps the most interest was Rachel Green, Jennifer Aniston's now-iconic character. Though all six "main" characters shared the title of 'lead,' many fans cared more about Rachel and her love story with Ross than anything else that was happening on the show.</p><p>And yes, Rachel Green was a strong female character that plenty of viewers could relate to.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel Green wore some amazing fashions</a>, was all over growing her career, and definitely cared about her friends. But fans admit, she wasn't perfect.</p><p>The character seemed especially doomed in all her failed relationships.&nbsp;In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans think Rachel was even more toxic than Ross</a> in their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All Of Rachel Green’s Love Interests, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><p>Still, some fan theories are met with criticism. Even today, passionate fans will argue over Ross and Rachel's "break," a true sign that the characters are still as engaging as ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But of all the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan theories about Rachel Green</a>, one from Lorne Brown, a self-proclaimed 'critical' watcher of 'Friends,'&nbsp;seems to have&nbsp;the most merit.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quora</a> question posited whether fans thought Ross would have said the right name at his wedding to Emily if Rachel hadn't shown up. At that, the truth was revealed: Rachel was super selfish showing up at Ross' nuptials.</p><p>Think about it, Brown says: Like Phoebe and the airline passenger agreed, Rachel showing up at Ross's wedding would "disrupt and ruin" the ceremony. The thing is, Rachel was&nbsp;hoping that's what would happen, so she went into the "adventure" aiming to keep Ross from getting married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Jennifer-Aniston-as-Rachel-Green-Hugh-Laurie-airplane-Friends.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That in itself is super selfish, because Rachel knew that showing up there would throw off the balance (and Ross's concentration on his vows).</p><p>Other fans tend to argue that because Rachel didn't confront Ross and tell him she still loved him, it wasn't her fault he flubbed his vows to Emily. In their view, she didn't&nbsp;do anything except show up.</p><p>That was enough, says the theory confirmation: the psychological effect of Rachel's sudden appearance (in&nbsp;London no less, it's not like she was just happening by and popped in for cake) broke Ross's focus.</p><p>Fun fact, notes&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends Fandom</a>; "The One with Ross' Wedding" was filmed on location in London&nbsp;and in front of a British studio audience.</p><p>Anyway, if Rachel Green hadn't shown up, fans suggest, Ross wouldn't have thought of her at all. His concentration would have been on Emily, and he never would have said Rachel's name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sure, maybe he would've gotten cold feet anyhow, but he certainly wouldn't have ruined his own wedding. And honestly, Rachel showing up and setting things in motion was a selfish, intentional move that casts a shadow on an otherwise picture-perfect character.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some 'Friends' Fans Think That Rachel Never Deserved Ross</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0edGamqGdnGK0s7HEp2SsnZybtrS0jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
