The Tesla CEO has taken a variety o f4-minute jet trips, which would’ve only been slightly longer had he taken a car.</p><p>For example, Musk’s jet has been flown several times from Los Angeles International Airport to Hawthorne Airport. There’s only 6 miles between the two airports, which is a 10-minute drive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“ <a href=#>I’m not really [surprised] people react</a> ,” Sweeney told <a href=#>CNBC</a> . “There are so many reasons they have to be surprised. The fact that [flights] are even trackable, that it’s a celebrity and it’s a quick flight.”</p><p>Musk hasn’t commented on Sweeney’s recent revelation. But he has had <a href=#>beef with the teenager in the past</a>.</p><p>In January, Sweeney revealed he rejected a $5,000 offer from Musk to close his @ElonJet account. The offer backfired in Musk’s face. Not only did Sweeney decline it, but the news helped the Twitter account become even more popular. It now has almost half a million followers – most of his accounts do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this month, Kylie Jenner received backlash after she was exposed for <a href=#>taking a 12-minute flight in her jet.</a> She was branded a “climate criminal” by many outspoken people online.</p><p>More recently, Drake was similarly slammed for taking a <a href=#>14-minute trip from Toronto to Hamilton</a>, which would’ve taken only an hour by car. @CelebJets revealed the 38-mile flight took flight took 402 gallons (or 1,522 litres) of fuel, costing over $2,700. This produced four tons of CO2 emissions.</p><p>While the public is being told to do what they can to curb climate change, it’s becoming clear that celebrities, too, need to think with sustainability in mind – meaning no short jet trips.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>These Celebrities Charge Thousands On Cameo For Seconds-Long Videos</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>CNBC</a>, <a href=#>Twitter @CelebJets</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSyrbvNZqSuq5titrR5wa6pp6GenHqkrdKhZJ%2BtlaF6o8WMppikoZ6cenZ5zKKlrqyVYsGztc%2BsZKimXZ22tHnJnqto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
