I’m really pulling for him in this house. I think it would be great for him if he won this whole thing, it would really propel him into a new stage.”</p><p class=p1>While O’Connell <a href=#>discussed his fan theories</a> with the former news anchor, he dished that he’s a big fan of&nbsp;<i>Big Brother.</i></p><p class=p1>“I’ve been watching since the beginning, but I <a href=#>take a particular liking to </a><i><a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a>&nbsp;</i>because — I’m not that famous — but I am a celebrity, a self-described celebrity and I know half the people in this house,” the&nbsp;<i>Sliders&nbsp;</i>alum said. “I’ve seen every <a href=#><strong>Todrick [Hall]</strong></a> show, <a href=#><strong>Carson [Kressley]</strong> </a>is incredible. I mean, I met <strong>Todd Bridges</strong>, I’ve met all of them. And&nbsp;<i>Celebrity Big Brother&nbsp;</i>to me, because unscripted or reality television is so popular, you know [like] <a href=#><strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong></a>, these people are experts at unscripted television so <a href=#>it’s literally like an all-star game in there</a>.”</p><p class=p1>O’Connell also expressed his interest in following in <a href=#>the season 3 competitors’ footsteps</a> next season: “Listen, I’m here, let’s make it happen. … Where do I sign?”</p><p class=p1>Throughout the&nbsp;<i>Darkness to Light&nbsp;</i>author’s stint in the&nbsp;<i>Big Brother&nbsp;</i>house, which began airing earlier this month, <a href=#>he’s been vocal about his past relationship</a> with the Good American cofounder, 37. (The duo were married for four years between 2009 and 2013 before Kardashian filed for divorce. It was finalized in December 2016.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“When I married Khloé, there’s just so many things that I did wrong when it came to that relationship,” Odom told the cameras during the February 14 episode. “If I could take it back, of course I’d take it back.
