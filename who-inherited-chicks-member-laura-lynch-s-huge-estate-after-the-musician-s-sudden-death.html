The Chicks are as famous for their political views as they are for songs like "Landslide." Like <a href=#><strong>Dolly Parton</strong></a>, the Chicks members speak their minds about what matters to them. They don't seem to mind if people disagree with them, which is admirable.</p><p>At the end of December 2023, Laura Lynch, one of the founding members of the Chicks, tragically died. Since she was part of the popular band for a little while, fans are curious about who received the money that she left behind.</p><h2 id=the-chicks-founding-member-laura-lynch-39-s-family-likely-inherited-her-estate>The Chicks Founding Member Laura Lynch's Family Likely Inherited Her Estate</h2><p>While there has been no official confirmation, Laura Lynch likely left her money to her <strong>husband, Mac Tull, and their daughter, Asia</strong>. Since Lynch's cousin Mick Lynch is the one who shared the sad news of her passing with media outlets, it's possible that they were close and she left him some money as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dixie-chicks.jpg><p><strong>Laura Lynch's net worth is unknown</strong>. But since she was part of the Dixie Chicks when they first began making music, it seems likely that she made some good money. The Chicks are some of <a href=#>the wealthiest country musicians</a>, and according to Fox Business, their <strong>net worth is $150 million</strong>.</p><p>If someone prepares for their death and sets up a will and trust, then it's easier for their relatives to deal with the question of who inherits their estate afterward. According to Willfill.co, sometimes things don't work out quite that easily. For example, when Anna Nicole Smith passed away, Daniel, her child, inherited her estate. But her daughter, Dannielynn, wasn't included in the will since Smith didn't mention what would happen if she had more kids. However, in the case of Laura Lynch, she had one child. It seems likely that her will and estate were straightforward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/who-inherited-chicks-member-laura-lynch-s-huge-estate-after-the-musician-s-sudden-death_-the-chiks-_youtube.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/why-maren-morris-husband-net-worth-rivals-her-own.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Maren Morris' Battle With Country Music Goes Deeper Than Being Called 'Not Country Enough'</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Maren Morris is a popular country music singer, but she has been vocal about issues she has with the music industry.</span><p>Forbes also reported that sometimes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stars's estates become complicated</a>.

His wife only received 20% of the actor's estate, and 55% of the estate was used for taxes.

At that time, she wanted to focus on being a mom to Asia, and they began living in Mineral Wells. The publication reported that <strong>in 1997, Laura Lynch married Mac Tull</strong>. They used to be friends and they reconnected thanks to the fact that they were both at an open house. When interviewed by Myplainview.com, Lynch explained that while the current members of the Chicks were critical of former president George Bush, she didn't agree with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/carl-thomas-dean-lives-a-very-secretive-life-despite-being-married-to-dolly-parton-edited-copy.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Dolly Parton's Husband Of Six Decades Doesn't Even Like Country Music</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dolly Parton's husband, Carl Dean certainly loves Dolly.

We hold a special place in our hearts for the time we spent playing music, laughing and traveling together. Laura was a bright light…her infectious energy and humor gave a spark to the early days of our band. Laura had a gift for design, a love of all things Texas and was instrumental in the early success of the band. Her undeniable talents helped propel us beyond busking on street corners to stages all across Texas and the mid-West.
