His annual income is around $7 million through his musical career, with a Spotify and Apple Music income of $6 million. Fans are not wrong to think that his net worth has definitely been affected by his acting career. It was actually reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MGK has made about $4 million from his movies and TV shows</a>.</p><p>His acting career is considered successful and thriving, and MGK knew it from the start. In an interview with Collider, MGK admitted, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I’ve felt like I have charisma on camera</a> since the Jacka** days, when we were in 6th grade, picking up a camera and filming ourselves doing stupid stunts.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He is not wrong. MGK, or Baker, has been acting since 2014. His first role was in the movie, “Beyond the lights.” Since then, he has been in many other projects and movies such as, “Captive State”, “Viral”, “The Land,” and “The King of Staten Island” alongside his best friend, whom <a href=#>MGK shares a tight relationship with, Pete Davidson</a>. MGK has also been on a TV show called, “The Roadies.”</p><p>While almost everybody knows that he’s been in a movie called, “Midnight in the Switchgrass,” because that’s how he met his ‘twin flame’, Megan Fox, he’s also been in some amazing movies where he was the leading star.</p><h2 id=the-last-son-is-machine-gun-kelly-s-first-solo-lead><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>"The Last Son" Is Machine Gun Kelly's First Solo Lead</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This movie is MGK’s first solo leading role.

MGK’s character, Cal, is one of his sons, and he is tormented by his past, so he goes on his mission to take revenge.</p><p>MGK stated that, "If the movie’s called ‘The Last Son’ and the last son isn’t interesting and compelling … there is no movie. So I appreciated the task of living up to the title because that was something I’d never had in my acting career before.”</p><h2 id=machine-gun-kelly-played-tommy-lee-in-ldquo-the-dirt-rdquo><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Machine Gun Kelly Played Tommy Lee in “The Dirt”</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is another movie where MGK was one of the main leads.

The main leads of the movie are Bruce Willis, Megan Fox, Emile Hirsch, and Colson Baker, of course. The movie is about an FBI agent and an officer who work together to investigate unsolved cases. Matter of fact, MGK said in an interview with Cosmopolitan that the only reason he took the movie was that his scenes were with Fox.</p><h2 id=machine-gun-kelly-being-in-birdbox-surprised-the-fans><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Machine Gun Kelly Being In "BirdBox" Surprised The Fans</span></h2><p>Starring Sandra Bullock, John Malkovich, and Sarah Paulson, MGK had a minor role in this movie, but it is yet another Netflix movie that he got to be a part of.
