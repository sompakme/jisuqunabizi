She might be keeping that quiet, or she might still be single.</p><p>Chase Sui Wonders's life definitely looks different right now since actors aren't filming any projects because of the WGA/SAF-AFTRA strike that began on May 2nd, 2023. She also isn't able to give interviews where she is promoting anything that has recently been released.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Chase Sui Wonders Was Discovered By Sofia Coppola</a></span></p><p>Besides that, it seems that Wonders is still living in New York City, which she has been for a while. In April 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chloe Fineman and Chase Sui Wonders chatted</a> for Interview Magazine and Wonders shared that she had an apartment in the East Village.

She said, "I’m just getting back into town, getting my life in order. I’m writing today. I’ve been working on this TV script for a while. We’re trying to push it across the finish line and get all the kinks out."</p><p>Wonders hasn't shared any more information about her writing. It's possible that she is still in the midst of the creative process and there haven't been any updates to share. Of course, with the ongoing strike, no TV show or movie deals or being made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chase-sui-wonders.jpg><p>While she hasn't explained how she is spending her time now that she is no longer dating Pete Davidson, Chase Sui Wonders has always been super creative. In 2021, she said in an interview with W Magazine that when she lived with her mom at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, she did a lot of drawing.</p><p>Wonders said, "Even if I didn’t do anything all day, I would make an attempt to draw because even as quiet and mundane and maddening as that time was, drawing taps into a meditative state,” she said.</p><p>“It’s such a quiet and calm act and not always stimulating, but I tap into a state where I’m spending time and attention doing something and it feels like a recharge. You can just laser your focus in on something creative. I definitely turn to it as a coping mechanism.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chase-sui-wonders-pete-davidson-bodies-bodies-bodies-01-700x400-1.jpg><p>Chase Sui Wonders isn't able to do any more promotion for her latest TV shows Bupkis, which also stars Pete Davidson, or City on Fire. Her next project is a movie called Little Death that also stars Jena Malone and David Schwimmer. According to the movie's IMDb page, it's currently in post-production.
