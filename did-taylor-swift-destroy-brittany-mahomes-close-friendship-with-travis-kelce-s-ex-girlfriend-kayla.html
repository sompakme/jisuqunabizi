It's always heartbreaking when a new partner changes an existing friendship, and that could be the case here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/brittany-patrick-mahomes.jpg><p>According to The Daily Mail, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kayla Nicole stopped following Brittany Mahomes</a>.

Instead of just not looking at Brittany's posts or even muting her for a little while, Kayla wanted to stop following her friend altogether. Fans could guess that maybe she didn't want to see Brittany posting any photos with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.

As he explained to E! News, "I didn't just go through every single pic and just start liking it immediately. It was over the course of a month's span, just following her and liking the pictures that she was posting and watching all of her stories when stories had first started coming out. I was just stalking her and then finally on New Year's, she gave in. And, you know, New Year new me. She just shot her shot, jumped in my DMs and the rest is history."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>People wonder about the status of Kayla Nicole and Brittany Mahomes' friendship because Brittany and Taylor seem to have become friends. At the very least, they have been spending time together over the past few weeks.</p><p>If Taylor and Travis really are dating and they become more serious, it seems likely that Brittany and Taylor will hang out even more.</p><p>People reported that Brittany and Taylor had dinner at the New York City restaurant Emilio’s Ballato along with Taylor's friends Sophie Turner and Blake Lively the night before the October 1st 2023 Kansas City Chiefs game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This suggests that Taylor wanted to get to know Brittany better and also introduce her to some famous pals that she hangs out with regularly. Brittany and Taylor also watched the game from the Kansas City Chiefs MetLife Stadium suite, which must have given them some time to bond.</p><p>It's true that sometimes, a friendship just naturally runs its course. However, because Brittany Mahomes and Kayla Nicole seemed to get along so well, fans can't help but speculate that their friendship could be over. While Brittany hasn't said that she is sad about Kayla no longer following her on Instagram, fans can guess that wasn't a very fun moment for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbr7UoqVmmqKewbWtzbJkppmYpLqmv4yfqaKdnpnAqbXPZq6irJhiwbOt1aKqZqOVobCmv4yer2afmae5p77InqWdZZuWxq2tjKegnKecmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
