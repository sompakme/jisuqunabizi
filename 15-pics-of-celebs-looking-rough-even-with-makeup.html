They&nbsp;are popular and well-known&nbsp;which means that they constantly appear in the media. This means there’s a lot pressure on their part to look outstanding. As a result, celebs invest in professional makeup artists, fitness trainers and beauty gurus. They undergo plastic surgery procedures and are the first ones to try various beauty tricks that promise to make one more beautiful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celebs are constantly scrutinized by fans and their appearance is dissected bit by bit. No celeb wants to appear in the “ugliest celebrities” lists and yet many do.</p><p>Makeup is an easy way for celebrities, at least female celebrities, to alter their appearance. Makeup is not as drastic as plastic surgery and is a fun and easy way to experiment with one’s&nbsp;looks.</p><p>However, while some celebrities can change their appearance drastically with makeup, others can’t. In fact, some celebrities look just as rough with makeup as they did without it. In some cases, celebs look even worse with makeup, especially if they applied it poorly or if their makeup artist is an amateur who has no idea what he or she is doing.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga>Lady Gaga</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga</a> is certainly a talented singer, but her appearance is almost always shocking. Lady Gaga’s clothes and her makeup are interesting to the point where she always stands out. But is standing out a good thing? Especially when her makeup doesn’t even make her more attractive?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lady Gaga has recently said that she is going to drastically change her appearance – “To be frank, I would just prefer to go through this album cycle and talk about my music. That’d be great. It becomes about everything else, and that was what I [once] wanted. But if I wear a black T-shirt and black pants every day, [people] might listen to what I write. All the outfits, fashion and art pieces over the years made sense to me. They didn’t make sense to other people.”</p><h2 id=courtney-love>Courtney Love</h2><p>The singer and actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney Love</a> was once a beautiful woman. However, nowadays she does not look so great, even when she wears plenty of makeup. How did the appearance of a woman, who was once so beautiful, change so much? Easy answer: drug abuse and plastic surgery addiction!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Love had admitted in the past that she struggled with her drug addiction. And she has also confessed that she got her very first facelift when she was only 35 years old – “Nobody ask me about aging gracefully, please. Come on, I took advice from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldie Hawn</a> when she said I should get a facelift at 35!”</p><h2 id=donatella-versace>Donatella Versace</h2><p>There’s no denying that the Italian fashion designer and vice president of the Versace Group, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donatella Versace</a>, was once a beautiful woman. But like many other beautiful women who are celebrities, she couldn’t resist trying to make herself even more beautiful.</p><p>Versace has clearly undergone many plastic surgery operations which completely ruined her good looks. She has only admitted to getting Botox, however. Interestingly, Versace seems to think that she looks good – “I’m not like this genetically. I use tonnes of cream and take care of my hair and skin.” She has also said – “I stopped working with a personal trainer as he wouldn’t let me smoke.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tori-spelling>Tori Spelling</h2><p>The actress and TV personality <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tori Spelling</a> is probably best known for her role as Donna Martin in Beverly Hills. She is also the author of her autobiographical book Stori Telling. There’s no denying that Tori Spelling was a beautiful woman when she was younger.</p><p>However, Spelling underwent plastic surgery procedures in the past which changed her appearance. Nowadays she looks rather rough even when she wears makeup. She has admitted to having had a nose job and breast augmentation and said – “Well, I got my boobs done in my early 20’s and if I had known it would or could possibly impact production of milk, I would never had had them done.”</p><h2 id=pamela-anderson>Pamela Anderson</h2><p>The actress and model <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pamela Anderson</a> rose to fame after she was selected as Playmate of the Month for the February 1990 issue of Playboy&nbsp;magazine. Nowadays however she is probably best known for her roles in Home Improvement, Baywatch and V.I.P.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there is no denying that Anderson was once an incredibly beautiful woman, nowadays she looks rather rough and no amount of makeup can hide it.</p><p>It seems that Anderson is one of many celebrities trying to battle the aging process – recently it has been rumored that she had plastic surgery. A surgeon has commented on her new appearance, saying – “After looking at pictures of Pamela from last year’s Cannes festivities and comparing them with the pictures taken last week, I can see many signs of surgery she’s possible had done.”</p><h2 id=kelly-osbourne>Kelly Osbourne</h2><p>The singer, actress and TV presenter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Osbourne</a> has been criticized for her appearance for as long as we can remember. Osbourne hasn’t had an easy life – growing up with famous parents can be tough and as a result she was, at one point, really into drugs and drinking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Osbourne has battled with her weight almost all her life but recently came to accept her size. Recently she also started wearing better makeup – “I’ve always loved makeup and all things beauty. My look has evolved over time, but I always get to have fun and work with the most creative people who help me reinvent my look all the time.” However, even with the new makeup she looks rough.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan>Lindsay Lohan</h2><p>We all expected the actress and singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan</a> to go far in life. Most of us thought that her career in the acting business would flourish as she grew older. Alas, that was not the case. Like most celebs who became famous far too young, Lohan began doing drugs and drinking excessively.</p><p>Lohan was beautiful as a teen and a young woman, but her appearance has changed drastically recently, and not for the better. Some speculate that she has had plastic surgery procedures – “No more botox Lindsay!!! I miss your old look... You look perfect natural” Another person said – “Since when the f*** did Lindsey look like this?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lena-dunham>Lena Dunham</h2><p>The actress, producer, and director <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lena Dunham</a> is probably best known as the creator of the popular HBO series Girls. She has received numerous Emmy Award nominations for the show (in which she herself stars) as well as two Golden Globe Awards.</p><p>In 2013 Dunham was the first woman to win the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series. That same year, Dunham was included in Time magazine most influential people list.</p><p>You wouldn’t exactly call Dunham beautiful, even when she wears plenty of makeup. But the actress has said – “I feel prettier with a naked face and chapstick.”</p><h2 id=rosie-o-donnell>Rosie O’Donnell</h2><p>The comedian, actress and TV personality Rosie O’Donnell is probably best known for her roles in A League of Their Own, Sleepless in Seattle and Beautiful Girls. O’Donnell often appears in lists that record the least attractive celebrities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Beautiful Girls O’Donnell played a woman named Gina who explained the difference between real and artificial beauty – “Look at the hair. The hair is long, it’s flowing, it’s like a river. Well, it’s a f***ing weave, okay? And the tits, please! I could hang my overcoat on them. Tits by design were invented to be suckled by babies. Yes, they’re purely functional. These are silicon city. And look, my favourite, the shaved pubis. Pubic hair being too unruly and all. Very keys. This is a mockery, this is a sham, this is bullshit. Implants, collagen, plastic, capped teeth, the fat sucked out, the hair extended, the nose fixed, the bush shaved... These are not real women, all right? They’re beauty freaks.”</p><h2 id=cher>Cher</h2><p>The singer and actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cher</a> has been a beauty in the past and hasn’t aged horribly. However, she does look a little rough, even with plenty of makeup on. Cher tries to lead a healthy life – “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, I eat really good food.” And, according to her, she has “great genes” from her mother and grandmother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That may be so, but she gets plenty of outside help when it comes to her looks – “There’s a team of five dozen people, and it takes them two hours. That’s the truth.” This just shows that even a team of professionals&nbsp;can't do an awful lot when it comes to appearance.</p><h2 id=sandra-bernhard>Sandra Bernhard</h2><p>The model, actress, and comedian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra Bernhard</a> is a talented woman. While she was not exactly a beauty when she was young, you can’t deny that her appearance was interesting and unique. Nowadays, she looks rather rough, even with plenty of makeup on but what she lacks in appearance she makes up for in her personality.</p><p>In 1992, Bernhard posed for Playboy magazine cover and said – “I thought it would be ironic to do if we had complete creative control and crossed all kinds of sexual barriers. I think it’s really important that a woman who is not a cliché beauty, who hasn’t been manipulated by men, or altered herself surgically, be presented in a really beautiful, sensual, forthright way.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joan-van-ark>Joan Van Ark</h2><p>The actress Joan Van Ark is probably best known for her role as Valene Ewing in the soap opera Dallas and Knots Landing. She was stunning when she was young but nowadays she looks terrible and no amount of makeup can hide her ruined looks.</p><p>It is obvious that Van Ark has undergone numerous plastic surgery procedures. In fact, in a recent interview Van Ark said that plastic surgeries nowadays are “the norm” and “expected”. However, clearly, her plastic surgery procedures did not go very well. Whenever she appears in public her face is coated in heavy makeup. Her painted eyebrows and her heavy eye makeup look especially ridiculous.</p><h2 id=rachel-dratch>Rachel Dratch</h2><p>The actress and comedian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel Dratch</a> is another talented woman who is not exactly beautiful. No amount of makeup can make her attractive and the internet is full of articles such as “Is Rachel Dratch too ugly for Hollywood?” and “Hollywood Thinks Rachel Dratch Is a Troll.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few years ago, Dratch released a book called Girl Walks into a Bar: Comedy Calamities, Dating Disasters, and a Midlife Miracle in which she said – “If you saw me walking down the street, you wouldn’t point at me and recoil, but by Hollywood’s standards, I’m a troll, ogre, woodland creature, or manly lesbian.”</p><h2 id=zosia-mamet>Zosia Mamet</h2><p>If you’re into watching TV series, then you’ve probably seen Zozia Mamet. She has appeared in TV series such as Mad Men, United States of Tara, Parenthood, and Girls. Mamet is not exactly beautiful and even with makeup she looks a bit rough. However, she is certainly talented and we are bound to see more of her.</p><p>Mamet thinks that we should all feel comfortable in our own skin – “I saw a girl on the subway the other day who had blacked out her eyebrows and then painted blue eyebrows above, and she had a green situation happening below that, and I was just like, You go, man. It’s the idea of being confident in your choices, if it’s your hair regime or your eyebrows, to just feel good about your choices and not be afraid to try things.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=roxy-saint>Roxy Saint</h2><p>The singer, actress and director Roxy Saint is probably best known for her role in Zombie Strippers and for playing in the band Roxy Saint and the Blackouts. Roxy Saint plays in a goth band so it is only natural that her appearance matches the band.</p><p>Her makeup is often very dark and messy and it makes her look rather rough. There is not much information about Roxy online which is no surprise. We all know that Hollywood and the media prefer celebs that are beautiful. It seems that beauty trumps talent almost every time (although there are exceptions).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ltqS%2FjKidZpuVobKjv4ylpqijmaO0br7Orp6hZZWrsq951qKroWWdlrimwc9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
