She also hasn’t been employed in some time, as she admitted to the court in 2019 that she hadn’t worked the entire year. Rather, she was relying on the money she “borrowed” from her kids’ trusts as well as “a lot of hope of and a lot of prayer.”</p><p><a href=#>The Ashley</a> notes that despite Kate’s financial challenges (and lack of job), she bought a new home in 2019 for $750,000.</p><p>The court documents reveal Kate believes she’s owed money from the trust given the school tuition she and Jon paid for with their incomes in past years. “So, I mean, I’m not looking to collect that but I borrowed $100,000 from the kids’ trust,” she stated. “And it owes me $387,000 technically.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following her statements, a judge ruled that there need to be “evidence of repayments.” The judge also disagreed with Kate’s claims that she’s unable to work, saying there’s no evidence to suggest she’s unfit to provide an income for her household.</p><p>Jon and Kate’s eldest children, twins Cara and Maddy, are away attending college. Two of their sextuplets, Hannah and Collin, live with Jon, while the other four remain in their mom’s car.&nbsp;Jon says Kate has made no effort to repay Hannah and Collin, and he’s unsure if she’s put any money back in their other kids’ accounts.</p><p>So far, Kate hasn’t publicly responded to her ex-husband’s allegations.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Brooklyn Beckham Swears His Chef Gig Pays The Bills (Not His Parents)</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Sun</a>, <a href=#>The Ashley</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8qaq55ll6TAtLHLoqVmq6SkuaZ5kGlnaWhgYrOzu8xmn56qXaC2pb%2BMoZyrZZWtequ7zWaqmrGjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
