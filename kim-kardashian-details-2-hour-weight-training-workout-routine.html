We lift weights for two hours daily and do 5 or 6 days a week.”</p><p>The California native explained that her initial goal “was to gain muscle and be strong” — and she’s seeing results. “I see such a difference already,” she wrote. “I’m proud of our commitment together. It always starts with small goals 💪🏼.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kim-Kardashian-Details-2-Hour-Weight-Training-Workout-3.jpg><p>Kardashian donned a <a href=#>black sports bra and matching leggings</a> while giving fans a glimpse of how she spends her time in the gym. She began in a “split stance” before going on to show lateral squats using a band around her thighs. The reality star <a href=#>held a 40-pound weight</a>, noting that she does four sets of squats on each side.</p><p>As her workout continued, the Selfish author demonstrated a kneeling squat with the same 40-pound weight. She later admitted that she’s <a href=#>not always looking forward</a> to some of the exercises.</p><p>“Heels elevated banded goblet squats to seat with a 20 lb weight,” she captioned a clip of herself executing the move. “This exercise is one of my least favorites but you gotta push through even when you don’t want to and I’m scared of @senada.greca 😂.”</p><p>In her final Instagram Story from her workout, Kardashian focused on her triceps and deltoids. Her trainer gave encouraging corrections from behind the camera as <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>‘s <a href=#>“You Need to Calm Down”</a> played in the background.</p><p>The <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> alum has been candid about her fitness regimen and body transformation over the years. Earlier this month, <a href=#>she hit the gym with pal <strong>Kelly Rowland</strong></a>. “Nothing like working out [with] friends to keep you motivated 💋,” she captioned an Instagram Story selfie at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kim-Kardashian-Details-2-Hour-Weight-Training-Workout-2.jpg><p>The beauty mogul previously sparked backlash with <a href=#>her intense weight loss</a> ahead of the <a href=#>2022 Met Gala</a>, for which <a href=#>she wore Marylin Monroe’s iconic Bob Mackie dress</a> from 1962. Her journey to reaching her goal weight was captured on season 2 of The Kardashians.</p><p>“So, I fit into the dress, but I am not going to stop working out. I got this sauna suit and I put it on and it makes you sweat — even if it is water weight, it will help,” she said in a November 2022 episode.</p><p>She added: “This is exhausting, but it feels like a movie role. How an actor will lose weight for roles — <a href=#>this feels like my role is Marilyn Monroe</a>. I am determined.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Taylor-Swift-Kim-Kardashian-Details-2-Hour-Weight-Training-Workout.jpg><p>While walking the red carpet at the May 2022 event, Kardashian told Vogue that <a href=#>she “didn’t starve” herself</a> but was “so strict” leading up to the gala. Her comments <a href=#>quickly ignited a debate online</a>, prompting the Skims cofounder to defend her rigorous routine.</p><p>“It taught me a lot about my lifestyle and my health,” she said on the Today show after the bash. “Since then, afterward, I continued to eat really healthy. I’m not trying to lose any more weight, but I have more energy than ever. I cut out so much sugar, a lot of junk food I was eating … I just completely changed my lifestyle.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3qlsdOaoKWrXWd6qbvUq2SwnZmctbV506uYoqaZo7Ruw86roqitpGK%2FsMHToqWeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
