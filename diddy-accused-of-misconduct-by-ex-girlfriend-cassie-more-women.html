Us Weekly confirmed in November 2023 that Cassie (real name Casandra Ventura) filed a lawsuit against Diddy, accusing him of rape and repeated physical abuse that lasted nearly a decade. Cassie and Diddy dated off and on from 2007 to 2018.
“After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,” Cassie said in a statement."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs’s reputation and seeking a payday.”</p><p class=p1>Following Cassie’s complaint, several other women came forward with <a href=#>new or past accusations</a>, including Danity Kane’s <strong>Aubrey O’Day</strong> and<strong> Kimora Lee Simmons</strong>.</p><p class=p1>Keep reading for more details about the allegations against Diddy:</p><h3 class=p3><b>Cassie</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cassie-Multiple-Women-Accuse-Diddy-of-Misconduct.jpg><p class=p1>Cassie’s lawsuit came with a “trigger warning” notice at the top, noting that her claims contained “highly graphic information of a sexual nature.” Cassie asserted in her filing that Diddy often tried to control her when they were dating by taking drugs, physically hurting her and forcing her to have sex with male prostitutes on camera. She also claimed that Diddy forced his way into her home in 2018 and sexually assaulted her.</p><p class=p1>According to Cassie, Diddy also <a href=#>threatened to blow up</a> <strong>Kid Cudi</strong>’s car. Cudi, who Cassie started dating during one of her splits from Diddy, corroborated her claims to <i>The New York Times</i>. Cudi’s rep asserted that the rapper’s vehicle did explode after Diddy’s warning.</p><p class=p1>Diddy denied all of Cassie’s claims.</p><p>One day after filing the lawsuit, Cassie confirmed to Us through her attorney&nbsp;<strong>Douglas Wigdor</strong> that she and Diddy had reached a settlement.</p><p>“I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control,” the November 17 statement read. “I want to thank my family, fans and lawyers for their unwavering support.”</p><p>Diddy also released a statement distributed through Window, telling Us, “We have decided to resolve this matter amicably. I wish Cassie and her family all the best. Love.”</p><p>Following the settlement, attorney <strong>Neama Rahmani</strong> exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> that the case was likely settled so quickly was because “Cassie ran out of time,” noting that some of her allegations were “a little bit older.”</p><p>Rahmani went on to explain that a New York statute of limitations law about filing civil lawsuits and sexual assault cases was set to close days after Cassie’s filing. “Cassie was up against the clock and the parties really were unable to finalize their negotiations before that window was going to close,” he shared. “So, she was forced to file a lawsuit.”</p><h3 class=p3><b>Kimora Lee Simmons</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kimora-Lee-Simmons-Multiple-Women-Accuse-Diddy-of-Misconduct.jpg><p class=p1>In 2004, a then-pregnant Simmons was profiled by <i>New York </i>magazine<i> </i>when she attended the Manhattan City Center’s benefit performance of <i>The Owl and the Pussycat</i>. The interview referred to <a href=#>an alleged previous incident</a> where “Kimora said something to Combs and he threatened to hit her.” Per the profile, Diddy “eventually got down on his knees” to publicly apologize.</p><p class=p1>Kimora Lee, who was married to <strong>Russell Simmon</strong>s at the time, accepted Diddy’s apology. “I respect him for being a fierce entrepreneur and I appreciate knowing that everything he does is emulating my husband,” she told the outlet<i>.</i></p><h3 class=p3><b>Gina Huynh</b></h3><p class=p1>Huynh, also known as Virginia V, claimed during a 2019 interview on <a href=# rel=noopener>“Unwine With Tasha K”</a> that Diddy physically assaulted her at one point during their five-year relationship.</p><p class=p1>“He stomped on my stomach really hard — like, took the wind out of my breath,” she alleged. “I couldn’t breathe. He kept hitting me. I was pleading to him, ‘Can you just stop? I can’t breathe.’”</p><p class=p1>According to Huynh, Diddy also grabbed her by the hair and started “punching” the back of her head. “He was mentally, emotionally and physically abusing me. He would always compare me to Cassie and tell me that I’m the bad one, she’s a good one,” added Huynh.</p><p class=p1>Diddy never publicly addressed Huynh’s claims.</p><h3 class=p3><b>Aubrey O’Day</b></h3><p class=p1>O’Day first crossed paths with Diddy when she auditioned for his MTV series <i>Making the Band 3</i>. Diddy chose her to start Danity Kane alongside<strong> Dawn Richard</strong>, <strong>Shannon Bex</strong>, <strong>D. Woods</strong> and <strong>Aundrea Fimbres</strong>. The girl group was immediately signed to Diddy’s label Bad Boy Records. During <i>Making the Band 4, </i>Diddy revealed that O’Day had been kicked out of the band but claimed there was no bad blood.</p><p class=p1>O’Day previously told <i>Us </i>her side of the story in July 2019.</p><p class=p1>“Diddy broke us up in the height of our fame on national television, on MTV,” <a href=#>she claimed to <i>Us</i>.</a> “I want to talk about what we’re going through because I think what Danity Kane has gone through since then is so powerful for women, for people, for artists. We have had to learn everything the hard way since we were broken up by [Diddy] on national television.”</p><p class=p1>During a 2022 interview on <strong>Alex Cooper</strong>’s “Call Her Daddy” podcast, O’Day claimed she was fired from Danity Kane because she “wasn’t willing to do what was expected of [her] — not talent-wise, but in other areas.” In September 2023, O’Day further claimed that Diddy asked her to sign an NDA in exchange for Danity Kane’s publishing rights.</p><p class=p1>“I have to release him for any claims or wrongdoings or actions prior to the date of the release,” she alleged on the “OnlyStans” podcast. “I have to sign an NDA that I will never disparage Puff, Bad Boy, [Diddy’s mom] <strong>Janice Combs</strong>, or Justin Combs Music, or EMI, or Sony ever in public.”</p><p class=p1>O’Day has since <a href=# rel>been a vocal advocate for Cassie</a> following her lawsuit. “Money > accountability. Every time,” show wrote via her Instagram Story <a href=#>in reaction</a> to Cassie and Diddy’s November 2023 lawsuit settlement. “Welcome to another chapter of the system is well in place 💔.”</p><h3 class=p1>Joi Dickerson-Neal</h3><p class=p1>Dickerson-Neal <a href=#>filed a lawsuit</a> against Diddy in New York Supreme Court in November 2023. According to court docs obtained by Us at the time, Dickerson-Neal claimed the musician “drugged, sexually assaulted and abused” her during her time as a college student in 1991 and claimed Diddy created and distributed “revenge porn” featuring her in it.</p><p class=p1>In the lawsuit, Dickerson-Neal recalled appearing in one his music videos while studying at Syracuse University. The duo allegedly went out to dinner following the video shoot, after which Dickerson-Neal claims Diddy “intentionally drugged” her and assaulted her at his home. Dickerson-Neal alleges that Diddy filmed the incident and shared the footage with others.</p><p class=p1>Dickerson-Neal sued Diddy for “substantial and lifetime injuries,” as well as monetary compensation for “mental and emotional injury, distress, pain and suffering and injury to her reputation.”</p><p class=p1>A spokesperson for Diddy denied Dickerson-Neal’s allegations in a statement to <a href=# rel=noopener>CNN</a> at the time, calling her claims “made up and not credible” and “purely a money grab.” The statement continued: “Mr. Combs never assaulted her, and she implicates companies that did not exist.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Breaking-Down-All-of-the-Allegations-Against-Diddy-Cassi-s-Lawsuit-More-.jpg><h3 class=p1>Jane Doe</h3><p class=p1>In December 2023, an anonymous plaintiff, referred to as Jane Doe, accused Diddy of sex-trafficking and gang-raping her in 2008 in a Southern District of New York lawsuit. Doe, who was just 17 years old at the time of the alleged incident, said she was flown to New York City by Diddy to meet with him.</p><p class=p1>During their time together, Doe says Diddy and his friends forced themselves onto her after giving her “copious amounts of drugs and alcohol,” according to court docs obtained by <a href=#>Us</a>.</p><p class=p1>“As alleged in the complaint, Defendants preyed on a vulnerable high school teenager as part of a sex trafficking scheme that involved plying her with drugs and alcohol and transporting her by private jet to New York City where she was gang raped by the three individual defendants at Mr. Combs’ studio,” Doe’s attorney, <strong>Douglas H. Wigdor</strong>, told Us in a statement at the time. “The depravity of these abhorrent acts has, not surprisingly, scarred our client for life.”</p><p class=p1>Diddy once again denied any wrongdoing, telling Us in a statement, “ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.” He continued: “For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy. Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday.”</p><p class=p1>He ended his message by emphasizing he “did not do any of the awful things being alleged,” adding, “I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.”</p><h3 class=p1>Rodney ‘Lil Rod’ Jones</h3><p class=p1>Jones <a href=#>sued Diddy for $30 million</a> in damages in February 2024, accusing the rapper of drugging, threatening and sexually assaulting him for more than a year. In court docs obtained by <a href=# rel=noopener>NBC News</a>, Jones alleged that while living with Diddy from September 2022 to November 2023, he recorded audio of the rapper partaking in “serious illegal activity” with friends and colleagues. The music producer also claimed he was sexually harassed and assaulted by Diddy in the artist’s Florida, Los Angeles and New York homes and a yacht Diddy rented in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p class=p1>According to the lawsuit, the extent of Jones’ assaults and harassment included “constant unsolicited and unauthorized groping and touching of his anus.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Diddy’s attorney <strong>Shawn Holley</strong> called Jones a “liar” in a statement to Us. “Lil Rod is nothing more than a liar who filed a $30 million lawsuit, shamelessly looking for an undeserved payday,” he stated. “His reckless name-dropping about events that are pure fiction and simply did not happen is nothing more than a transparent attempt to garner headlines.”</p><p class=p1>Holley went on to add that Diddy and his team have “overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies” and that the “outlandish allegations” would be addressed in court.</p><p><i>If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, contact the <a href=# rel=noopener>National Sexual Assault Hotline</a> at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadoZSZxm6twpysrJ2UYrynecyiqpynnpnCpMCMm7BmnahitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqkrdKsoJ5lnaS%2FpnnWqKSepl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
