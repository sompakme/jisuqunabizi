But I’m not putting any pressure.”</p><p>Quinn added that she’s “still swollen” after giving birth to son Christian, but <a href=#>that’s not stopping her from living her life.</a></p><p>“I was in a swimsuit yesterday and I was just like, ’I don’t care what anyone thinks of me. I might look ridiculous and swollen but I don’t care. I had a baby,’” <a href=#>she recalled to Us</a>. “That’s powerful enough!”</p><p>The Netflix star, who is currently working on her new book How To Be a Boss Bitch, had an emergency C-section on May 15.</p><p>“I haven’t seen [my scar] yet because it’s actually covered with tape so I haven’t even seen that part. I just see swelling and tape — that’s pretty much all I see,” she said. “I’m just rolling with it!”</p><p>Quinn’s followers inquired about her post-baby body after she posted a series of snaps in a tight pink set on Sunday, May 30.</p><p>“Hot mama!!! These pictures are post baby?!” one fan asked to which she responded, “They are!”</p><p>Days later, she stepped out in a crop top with husband <a href=#><strong>Christian Richard</strong></a> in Palm Springs, showing off her nearly flat stomach.</p><p>As <a href=#>she returns to work and life after becoming a mother,</a> Quinn told Us that she isn’t worried about the mom-shamers.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve learned not to be so trigger-heavy when it comes to responding and that’s been really helpful,” she said. “I’m just like, ‘OK, if anyone actually knows me, they would know the real story.’ So no, I haven’t really gotten into it with people. … Like, I don’t owe [them] anything.”</p><p>Scroll through to see snaps of Quinn’s postpartum body:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNksKm%2ByKyroqaVYr62tc2nZKygn6zAbrvFn2SipqOWu6Z5z6iqraiRp8G2uYybpp2xXaW2pL%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
