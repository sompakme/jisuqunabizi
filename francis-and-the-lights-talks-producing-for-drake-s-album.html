I actually produced a track on Thank Me Later called ‘Karoake,'” revealed Francis. “It’s going to be the second track on the album. But really you should know that Drake’s performance gets better every show. It’s really just something to behold. The way the energy in the room changes, it’s unbelievable.”</p><p class=MsoNormal>While he wouldn’t disclose any other information on the song’s concept or sound, Francis told VIBE that he gave the track to the Toronto native in full confidence that he would take record to the next level. —Mikey Fresh</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5u%2ForrCoqpmmZ6Zeq21xqGrrGWklrmsv4ypqaicpZi2r7OMnamao5WoeqK4wa6kZm1ia4Z3ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
