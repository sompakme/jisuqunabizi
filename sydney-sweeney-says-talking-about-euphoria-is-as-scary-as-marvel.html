The event was a live taping of Horowitz’s <a href=#>“Happy Sad Confused” podcast</a>.</p><p>“Honestly, it’s, like, as scary as talking about Marvel,” Sweeney joked, comparing Euphoria to the notoriously secretive comic book movie franchise. “I said one thing, and it went everywhere.”</p><p><a href=#>Sweeney made her Marvel debut</a> as Julia Cornwall, a variation of Spider-Woman, in Sony’s Madame Web starring <strong>Dakota Johnson</strong>.</p><p>Earlier this month, Sweeney shared with Horowitz in a separate conversation that she wouldn’t be taking much time off after Madame Web, Anyone But You and her new horror movie, Immaculate. “I go into Euphoria,” she said on March 16. “I always feel like I go home. It’s like home when I go back to it.”</p><p>For some fans, this indicated that the next season of the <strong>Zendaya</strong>-led drama series would begin filming soon, as the next installment isn’t expected to be <a href=#>released until 2025</a>. People confirmed in November 2023 that production on season 3 would begin in 2024.</p><p></p><p>Further details regarding Euphoria season 3 remain scarce. In August 2023, series creator <strong>Sam Levinson</strong> told Elle that he viewed the upcoming season as a “film noir” that will explore “what it means to be an individual with principles in a corrupt world” through the eyes of Zendaya’s Rue.</p><p>Sweeney added on Wednesday that she was “excited” to return to the Euphoria set and continue Cassie’s story.</p><p>“I love Cassie,” she explained. “Cassie truly is a dream to play and as an actor, I’m so fortunate that I’ve had a character like her at such a young age. And, of course, I wanna keep living her crazy [life]. I love it.”</p><p>The White Lotus actress also discussed what makes Euphoria different than the other sets she’s worked on in her career.</p><p>“There’s a lot of reasons that it’s special,” she said. “I mean, we’re doing and playing characters that have meant so much to people, and it’s the longest production that I’ve ever been on, because each season takes eight to 10 months to film.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Euphoria-Alexa-Demie-Barbie-Ferreira-Maude-Apatow-Sophia-Rose-Wilson-Sydney-Sweeney.jpg><p>As for Madame Web, the Sony/Marvel venture was panned by critics and audiences alike, much like Sony’s last live-action entry in its growing Spider-Man Universe, Morbius. However, Sweeney wasn’t bothered too much by the box office flop, saying that her role in the film was a “strategic” career decision.</p><p>“To me, that film was a building block,” Sweeney said in an interview with <a href=#>GQ UK</a> published on Monday, March 18. “It’s what allowed me to build a relationship with Sony. Without doing Madame Web I wouldn’t have a relationship with the decision-makers over there.”</p><p>She added, “Because I did that, I was able to sell Anyone But You. I was able to get Barbarella.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqynJ6axm6%2F1p6cp52pYsCixdJmq5qkm567qHnAm6aurF2awrG0zqugmmWZqHqiv4ysmpqqqWKutHnMmqmvnZxk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
