The cameras zoomed in and viewers could see that Crystal’s hands appeared to be swollen with her veins visible.</p><p>“What’s happening to me? What’s happening?” Crystal asked. Kyle responded, “I’m going to call 911.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Crystal-Kung-Minkoff-Experiences-Apparent-Medical-Emergency-During-RHOBH-Cast-Trip-to-Spain-096.jpg><p>The women could be seen huddling around Crystal as the episode came to an end.</p><p>“The universe works in mysterious ways,” Kyle said in the episode, addressing Crystal’s health issue. “Last night these two were at each other’s throats and, right now, Crystal is at Annemarie’s mercy.”</p><p>Earlier in the episode, Crystal and Annemarie continued their fight from the previous episode. (Crystal called <a href=#>Annemarie “a bitch”</a> during last week’s installment.)</p><p>“Let’s talk about the Crystal situation. The first night <a href=#>Crystal and I met</a> was at a mutual friend’s house around the holidays,” Annemarie told the women during a full cast dinner. “The first thing Crystal said to me about this group of women was that you ladies were not intelligent, nobody was educated and you’re very shallow.”</p><p>Crystal was quick to deny those “ridiculous” claims.</p><p>“I would not say that to someone I just met, I do not feel that way,” Crystal told the women. Annemarie hit back, asking Crystal to “be honest.”</p><p>“And then you said, the ladies were ‘fake socialites’ and that you were the only true socialite in the group,” Annemarie’s claims about Crystal continued.</p><p>“Do I feel like Crystal could have said that? Yes, I can,” Dorit claimed in her confessional. “What that basically is saying is that this is my excuse for not being interesting because my intellect is too high. No, you’re boring.”</p><p>As the argument continued at the dinner table, Annemarie and Crystal went back and forth as the other women looked on.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You’re acting like a hormonal teenager,” Annemarie said. “You know what else I want from you? I want a thank you for giving you something to talk about and making your ass relevant.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BXtW6%2BxJyYqWWTp8a0wMClZKahnqC8p7KMoZisZZ2asaqvwKVknqWVp7SmusKyZKKmXai9orXNaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
