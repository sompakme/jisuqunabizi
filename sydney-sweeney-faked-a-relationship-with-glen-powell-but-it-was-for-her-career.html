Euphoria star <a href=#><strong>Sydney Sweeney</strong></a> and her co-star Glen Powell in their 2023 holiday movie Anyone But You had to make it the case.</p><p>Their chemistry elevated the typical screenplay to a romantic comedy worth watching, and <a href=#>Sweeney and Powell could not stop flirting with each other during the press tour</a>. The movie ended up being a box office hit, making over $219 million during its run in the theaters. The success led to rumors of a sequel in the works, but Sydney Sweeney's big break on the silver screen is partly due to her chemistry with Glen Powell.</p><p>Sydney Sweeney had a big break with Anyone But You, proving she can lead a cast in a film. However, her "fake" relationship with Glen Powell sold the movie more than the script, and they leaned heavily into the ship. Furthermore, she is slowly getting more projects, with back-to-back calls from Sony Pictures (specifically). She is, undoubtedly, one of the rising talents of her generation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-and-glen-powell-rsquo-s-quot-fake-quot-relationship-gave-them-their-big-break>Sydney Sweeney And Glen Powell’s "Fake" Relationship Gave Them Their Big Break</h2><h3 id=sweeney-and-powell-fueled-fan-speculation-by-leaning-on-their-rumored-fake-relationship>Sweeney and Powell fueled fan speculation by leaning on their rumored fake relationship</h3><p>Anyone But You was different from all Sydney Sweeney movies and TV shows because she had a lot to prove.

It's fun to give it to 'em," the Euphoria star said when asked about her chemistry with her co-star.</p><p>Before, while, and after promoting the film, the pair let fans run their imaginations wild and did not try to correct them, even though Sydney Sweeney was in a committed relationship and is engaged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sydney-sweeney-leaving-to-amc-empire-25-theatres.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sydney Sweeney Fuels Engagement Rumors As She's Spotted Leaving A Bridal Shop In LA">Sydney Sweeney Fuels Engagement Rumors As She's Spotted Leaving A Bridal Shop In LA</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Despite saying she couldn't see herself marrying before turning 30, Sydney Sweeney has reignited engagement rumors.</p><p>After the press tour, <a href=#>Sweeney and Powell frankly opened up about letting people believe they were in a relationship to boost interest</a>.</p><p>"That’s people wanting what’s on the screen off the screen, and sometimes you just have to lean into it a bit — and it worked wonderfully. Sydney is very smart," Powell told The New York Times.</p><p>"The two things that you have to sell a rom-com are fun and chemistry. Sydney and I have a ton of fun together, and we have a ton of effortless chemistry."</p><p>Understanding fan demands and giving exactly what they wanted turned out to be the catalyst that set off Sweeney and Powell's big break. Their fake secret relationship bagged them a possible sequel (although not officially confirmed) for Anyone But You, or at least, another romantic comedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sweeney was also an executive producer for the film, which helped propel her career holding the reins of production.

"Without doing 'Madame Web' I wouldn't have a relationship with the decision-makers over there. Everything in my career I do not just for that story, but strategic business decisions. Because I did that, I was able to sell 'Anyone but You.' I was able to get 'Barbarella.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Building a relationship with the studio paid off for The White Lotus actress because her own production company, Fifty-Fifty Films, will likely to benefit from the connection.</p><p>If the sequel of Anyone But You gets green-lighted, she will definitely be coming back as executive producer. Furthermore, her projects The Registration and Barberella will also be executive produced by her.</p><p>The savvy business move Sweeney took with Madame Web built a bridge for the in-demand actress, and the success of Anyone But You cemented her relationship with the studio.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fans-think-sydney-sweeney-s-snl-dress-ended-_wokeness_-in-hollywood-front-deposit-back-snl_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="These Sydney Sweeney Movies And TV Shows Made Her Popular">These Sydney Sweeney Movies And TV Shows Made Her Popular</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sydney Sweeney has faced questions about her ability to act, but her acting talents are abundantly clear with the body of work she has amassed.</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-movies-show-she-is-a-star-among-her-peers>Sydney Sweeney Movies Show She Is A Star Among Her Peers</h2><h3 id=the-upward-trajectory-of-sydney-sweeney-may-not-reach-its-peak-anytime-soon-for-the-actress>The upward trajectory of Sydney Sweeney may not reach its peak anytime soon for the actress</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sydney-sweeney-vanity-fair-oscar-party-1.jpg><p>This is far from her early days when <a href=#>Sweeney revealed she took roles early in her career because she needed to earn money</a>. Now the actress has the opportunity to pick roles based on her interest. Her choice to start her own production company also indicates her interest in projects that have meaning for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Euphoria and The White Lotus were breakout roles for Sydney, Anyone But You is another pivotal big break for her because it established her as a commercially successful movie actress with a talent for pushing projects and making them work.</p><p>In addition, Sweeney has perfectly capitalized on the popularity she got from Euphoria and The White Lotus, picking projects that would show her versatility, exempting her from being a victim of being typecast. Even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeney's role in Madame Web was also a smart career move</a> — despite the movie being a box office bomb.</p><p>Her role in Hollywood is written to make a difference, with some calling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sydney Sweeney a divisive star of her generation</a>, despite of the criticism she has received.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With her handling the wheels of her own production company, the actress has more options in playing unique characters. Immaculate, her second film as a producer projects Sweeney's options and hopes. And with more movies like Barbarella, The Registration, and a biopic about legendary boxer Christy Martin in the works, Sweeney is expanding her repertoire to include more versatile characters.</p><p>No wonder she is being compared with the likes of Margot Robbie and Ana de Armas, who did not want to fit in the bombshell mold Hollywood had fixed them in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqspyemsZuv9aenKedqWKzorfEZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWXobKvec%2Borp6knGKvqrOMm6memZtk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
