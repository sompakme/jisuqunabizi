Over the years, he built a career on his trademark humor, wit, and interviewing style. Letterman has also received a lot of attention over the years for his rivalry with fellow late night host Jay Leno.</p><p>While Letterman has chosen not to hold a grudge against Leno in their own battle, he had no problem defending <a href=#><strong>Conan O'Brien</strong></a> in his battle with the former Tonight Show host.</p><p>When O'Brien was brought in to replace Leno as host of the popular late night show, it was short-lived. Leno eventually took the gig back and O'Brien was out. During one of his monologs, Letterman defended O'Brien, resulting in cheers from his audience.</p><h2 id=david-letterman-poked-at-jay-in-his-monologue-when-conan-39-s-39-tonight-show-39-gig-came-to-an-end>David Letterman Poked At Jay In His Monologue When Conan's 'Tonight Show' Gig Came To An End</h2><p>On April 28, 2011, Letterman mentioned Leno's birthday during his opening monologue.</p><p>"Happy Birthday to Jay Leno, 61 years old today," he began. "Happy Birthday Jay."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Letterman continued, "Jay, of course, one of the few tyrants still alive," which resulted in cheers and applause from the audience.</p><p>Letterman then made a joke which seemed to defend Leno's rumored nemesis, Conan O'Brien.</p><p>"All of his friends got together and had a party," he said. "They had a cake and Jay cut the cake with the same knife he stuck on Conan's back."</p><p>Letterman also commented on Leno's plea to the public not to blame O'Brien for what was happening.</p><p>"No one is blaming Conan," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Letterman said</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Letterman also told his audience that this incident sees Leno behaving exactly how he knew him to be. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">While speaking with Oprah Winfrey on Oprah's Next Chapter in 2013</a>, Letterman addressed his own feud with Leno.</p><p>"Jay and I were friends — we were always friends, before all of this happened," Letterman said, referring to the moment Leno took over Johnny Carson's spot.</p><p>Letterman also revealed that those involved with The Tonight Show approached him to take over. Letterman asked them if Carson approved of the idea, but was told Carson didn't know about their asking him. Letterman told them that he wouldn't take the job unless Carson approved.</p><p>According to Letterman, Leno was announced as Carson's replacement shortly after that.</p><p>Letterman also told Winfrey about the time he spent with Leno in the early years. He said that whenever a fellow comic bombed, Leno would gather a group of comics to watch their performance and make fun of them. Letterman said that this would make him uncomfortable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/david-letterman-told-oprah-that-jay-leno-is-the-most-insecure-person-he-s-ever-known.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="David Letterman Once Told Oprah That Jay Leno Is 'The Most Insecure Person I've Ever Known'">David Letterman Once Told Oprah That Jay Leno Is 'The Most Insecure Person I've Ever Known'</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>David Letterman and Jay Leno have a bumpy history filled with ups and downs.</p><p>"I’ve never met anyone quite like Jay.

In the aftermath of Leno's return to The Tonight Show, Stern called Leno "a thief."</p><p>"He lifts bits directly from my show," Stern said. "‘Jay-Walking’ was lifted from my radio show!"</p><p>Stern also called Leno a "lapdog" for NBC and claimed he "sabotaged" O'Brien.

Instead, they would give the original time slot back to its previous host, Jay Leno. O'Brien decided to walk away and received a $32 million settlement and a new show on TBS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">O'Brien reflected on the ordeal with CBS News</a>. NBC's decision brought them a lot of bad publicity and a large amount of public support for O'Brien followed.</p><p>"That first day that I woke up and was no longer the host of The Tonight Show, I remember the first thought I had is 'I am not shaving.' And that was my small victory, you know. 'Ok, so I lost The Tonight Show but I'll show them, I'll stop shaving," O'Brien said when the reporter asked about his beard.</p><p>"This year has been, is still incomprehensible to me. The amount of stuff that's happened in my life in the last year is…it's gonna take me a long time to process it," he added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It just felt like the tone went very quickly from, 'Take your time, we understand this is a tough decision,' to you know, 'Let's go,'" O'Brien said. "And that probably helped me a little bit feel like, 'You know what? This environment doesn't feel right and I've been with these people a long time. And I don't like, I really don't like the way this is going.' And when it started to get toxic and I started to feel that I'm not sure these people even really want me here. Let's just…I can't do it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqtsdOtnKulkaN6tb7Im6ytnV2pwrO6xJ1kp6GXncGurdGeZKOZqWK5prrOZpqoppGjerCu0aKcp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
