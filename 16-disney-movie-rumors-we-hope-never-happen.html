Oftentimes, when you think of Walt Disney Studios, you think of animation and fantasy, movies that come with an important underlying message. These are also movies that make you smile and more importantly, they remind you that nothing is impossible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, the Walt Disney Company has grown to include other film businesses such as Marvel Studios, 21st Century Fox and Lucasfilm. And what this means is that we can certainly expect several more timeless films from Disney over the years. At present, Disney has already announced some of its movie plans down the road. Meanwhile, there are also some Disney movie rumors making their rounds online today. Let’s check out the ones we hope would never happen:</p><h2 id=chip-n-dale-rescue-rangers><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chip-N-Dale-Rescue-Rangers-via-youtube.com-The-Eighties-Dreams-channel.jpg><p>“Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Ranger” was an animated television show that aired from 1989 to 1990. And in each episode, these small furry animals set off to help out anyone in need. Although, that doesn’t mean that they don’t get in trouble themselves. As a classic, we have a lot of respect for this show. However, we really don’t see the point in doing a reboot on the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aladdin-2><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Aladdin 2</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aladdin-2-via-geektyrant.com_.jpg><p>Earlier this year, the live-action adaptation of the Disney classic “Aladdin” showed in theaters and took home over $1 billion in the box office. The music was fantastic. The costumes were elaborate. And actor Will Smith as the Genie was incredible. But do we really need an ‘Aladdin 2’? Perhaps, a standalone movie about the Genie would be more interesting.</p><h2 id=the-lion-king-2><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>The Lion King 2</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Lion-King-2-via-iowapublicradio.org_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you may know, this is essentially a year of live-action adaptations. And so, following the release of “Aladdin,” Disney also released a live-action version of “The Lion King.” However, the reception was lukewarm. Some of the words critics used were “bland” and pointless.” That alone tells you that we don’t really need to see part two.</p><h2 id=tron-3><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Tron 3</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tron-3-via-polygon.com_.jpg><p>When the original “Tron” movie came out back in 1982, everyone was mesmerized. After all, it was the depiction of a digital world that hasn’t largely materialized yet. However, when this movie was followed up by “Tron: Legacy” in 2010, reviews were mixed. Viewers didn’t think that the movie was still ahead of its time. And so, if the second ‘Tron’ didn’t do so well, what’s the point of doing a third film?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bolt-2><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Bolt 2</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bolt-2-via-ohmy.disney.com_.jpg><p>Does anyone still remember “Bolt”? This is a Disney animated movie about a loyal dog and his companion, who happens to be a young movie star. Clearly, it has been years since pop star Miley Cyrus had worked on this movie. A lot has happened since then. Cyrus has grown up and moved on. At the same time, there have been so many films produced about pets and animals in general. So, a “Bolt 2” movie isn’t really something we’re looking forward to.</p><h2 id=haunted-mansion><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Haunted Mansion</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Haunted-Mansion-via-gizmodo.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to reports, there are rumors that Disney is planning to make a movie based on one of its most popular theme park attractions. Sure, something spooky and fun may be nice to see. However, it might also turn out to be really boring after you get a good laugh, or two.</p><h2 id=a-bug-s-life-2><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>A Bug’s Life 2</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/A-Bug’s-Life-via-filmtakeout.com_.jpg><p>As far as sequels are concerned, there are also rumors that Disney is planning to do a follow-up to its 1998 animated film “A Bug’s Life.” It’s been more than 20 years since the original film came out. And in all honesty, it doesn’t seem that many have developed nostalgia for this movie. And so, a sequel is certainly not long-awaited.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bambi><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Bambi</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bambi-via-lamag.com_.jpg><p>Earlier this year, the website Fatherly reported that a follow-up or reboot to the Disney classic “Bambi” is probably in the works. However, it doesn’t sound like an animated movie that you would want your kids to see. In fact, the website argues that this rumored film might have a dark undertone. As you may recall, this film has a bit of firearm&nbsp;violence.</p><h2 id=cars-4><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Cars 4</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cars-4-via-inverse.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>‘Cars’ is one franchise that Disney has been making a lot of money on over the years. After showing the first film in 2006, the Pixar-produced film went on to become a rather successful film franchise. Not only that, but ‘Cars’ also gave way to new theme park rides and cool Disney merchandise. After three films, however, it’s safe to say that viewers aren’t begging for another one.</p><h2 id=planes-3><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Planes 3</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Planes-3-via-techfly.co_.uk_.jpg><p>The ‘Planes’ film franchise pretty much came about as a spin-off of the more famous ‘Cars’ franchise back in 2013. The following year, Disney decided to immediately follow the original film with “Planes: Fire & Rescue.” And while the follow-up was pretty fun to watch, it wasn’t compelling enough to make a case for a third film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=up-2><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Up 2</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Up-2-via-grandforksherald.com_.jpg><p>“Up” is an animated film that tells the tale of a widower who was determined to actualize the plans he made with his late wife. It’s a touching tale. It’s bittersweet. However, it isn’t exactly the kind of film that allows for a follow-up. What’s the plot going to be? Will Carl still be living in a house with balloons? Better question, would Carl still be alive today?</p><h2 id=hunchback-of-notre-dame><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Hunchback of Notre Dame</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame-via-vanityfair.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The “Hunchback of Notre Dame” is a true Disney classic. And according to a report from Polygon, Disney is putting together a stellar ensemble to do a live-action remake. In fact, Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz are reportedly back to write and compose songs. Meanwhile, Josh Gad is rumored to be producing and starring as Quasimodo. However, it’s been years since the original film showed in theaters and it seems, there’s a lack of general interest in seeing it again.</p><h2 id=charming><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Charming</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Prince-Charming-via-deadline.com_.jpg><p>According to several reports, there are plans to do a film based on Prince Charming from the 1950 classic “Cinderella.” At a time when there is a growing MeToo movement and more and more women are coming out with their stories of harassment, is this really the movie that Disney should produce?&nbsp;Is this the type of animated film that everyone wants to see right now?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=atlantis-the-lost-empire><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atlantis-The-Lost-Empire-via-wegotthiscovered.com_.jpg><p>Back in 2001, Disney came out with the animated film “Atlantis: The Lost Empire,” which was generally a flop. The reviews are generally lukewarm. Some say it’s decent. However, others also point out that the movie is nothing special. And so, it doesn’t really make sense for Disney to try to do a live-action remake of this film. This is the case even if Tom Holland is rumored to be on board, according to Seventeen.</p><h2 id=hercules><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Hercules</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hercules-via-reddit.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Way back in 1997, Disney came out with the animated film “Hercules.” It was a good film. It had incredible music and comedy. However, it fell short when it came to audiences. This is probably why Vulture refers to it as an “underrated masterpiece.” And if this is the case, is it really worth going through all the trouble to produce a remake?</p><h2 id=princess-diaries-3><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Princess Diaries 3</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Princess-Diaries-3-via-themarysue.com_.jpg><p>It has been quite some time since we’ve last seen the sequel to the original “Princess Diaries.” In fact, Anne Hathaway has gone on to portray more serious roles and Chis Pine has become a Hollywood heartthrob. And in all honesty, we’re not sure if many are still interested to see a part three. Perhaps, it’s time to just let Princess Mia live her happily ever after in our imaginations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources -&nbsp;Walt Disney Studios,&nbsp;Fatherly,&nbsp;Seventeen,&nbsp;Polygon &&nbsp;Vulture</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiboquemsZuuc6voJ6rXafCrrvRrGSwnV2dvLGxjKecr52iYrWivM%2BepWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
