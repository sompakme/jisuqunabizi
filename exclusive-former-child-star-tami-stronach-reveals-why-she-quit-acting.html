The original movie centers around a young boy, Bastian, as he's swept inside of a storybook and into the magical land of Fantasia. Bastian is Fantasia's only hope. Guided by the wise ruler, The Childlike Empress, Bastian is able to save the day. For most of us, it was just a great movie - but for the young cast, it was their first foray into the limelight. We spoke exclusively with Tami Stronach (The Childlike Empress) about her experiences in the industry as an 11-year-old star, and why she disappeared from our screens after playing such a successful role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>PREVIOUSLY: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CHILD STARS THAT SURVIVED FAME AND FORTUNE</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For most young actresses, landing a major role in a film that was a box office smash would propel them into endless movies. While Tami had every opportunity to further her acting career, it was the mid-80's and the world was offering her scripts that she wasn't prepared to take. "I loved being in that film so much," says the 45-year-old mother of one. "I loved that story so much. I do feel incredibly lucky to have been part of such a moving story. After the film, we were looking at the scripts that I received and they were really not appropriate for an 11-year-old. There was nudity, there was violence. I looked at my mom, and she looked at me and we were like, 'Are we ready for this?'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it may be shocking to hear that an actress as young as&nbsp;11&nbsp;was offered roles in movies with nudity, Tami went on to explain that it was very typical of the era. These days, the Israeli star is vocally supportive of the Time's Up and Me Too movements, attending the New York Women's March earlier this year alongside her daughter, Maya.</p><p>Instead of pursuing a Hollywood career, Stronach opted to put her energy into other elements of the arts, forging a successful career as a choreographer. Recently, she has launched children's entertainment company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper Canoe</a> alongside her husband, Greg. The company aims to create a mutually beneficial parent-child experience, with original songs and live performances that include workshops. So far, her latest endeavor has been a hit, gaining two coveted awards.</p><p>Tami is currently filming the independent comedy Ultra Low, alongside Lauren Holly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE CHILD STARS&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiskaK2br%2FTq6anmZOderLByK1kmpuknruoew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
