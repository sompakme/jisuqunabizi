She participated in many local theater productions through her school and church while still living in Kentucky. When she was nine years old, she had her first acting part as a prostitute in a church play based on the Book of Jonah.&nbsp;She continued to perform in church plays and school musicals for the next several years. A talent scout saw the actress on the street when she was 14 and scheduled an audition for talent agents when she was on a family holiday in New York City. The agents said she was the best they had ever seen from someone so young after her first audition.&nbsp;The actress's mother was not pleased with her daughter's wish to be an actress but eventually would be made proud. She entered the CESD Talent Agency and started auditioning in Los Angeles for roles. Lawrence dropped out of high school when she was 14 years old. She never completed high school or earned her GED.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jennifer_Lawrence-pic.jpg><p>Her acting career started with a small part in the TV pilot Company Town, which was never broadcast.
