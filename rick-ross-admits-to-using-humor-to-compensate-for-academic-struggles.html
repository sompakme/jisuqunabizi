However, the root of his comedic quips was born, in part, from attempting to compensate for his lack of academic achievement as a high school student.</p><p>During a recent interview, Ross revealed, “I was a jackass” while recalling his reputation in high school. “Without a doubt, I was a comedian, I had a good sense of humor. I was the funny dude and all that… And I don’t think it was just because I naturally wanted to be, but [because] I didn’t know the answers to the questions and all the stuff [the teachers were] writing on the wall.”</p><p>The 46-year-old, who spoke with <a href=# rel=nofollow>AfroTech</a> while promoting his new book The Perfect Day To Boss Up: A Hustler’s Guide To Building Your Empire, also admitted to struggling with learning advanced math skills, such as multiplication and algebra. “That might’ve been my way to cover that up because I never understood. I never learned my multiplication still to this day,” Ross shared. “Imagine when they began going into pre-algebra A=E, that sh*t was like a whole ’nother language to me.”</p><p>To help hide his deficiencies in mathematics, Rozay decided to build his skills as an orator, which helped lead him to the successful career he currently enjoys as a rap star and author. “I just wanted to walk out of the goddamn…’What are you talking about? A=E? What is this?’ I knew right then, while I was sitting in the math class, I wanted to learn how to be a great speaker because when I’m speaking to somebody, I don’t want them to know my shortcomings in my other areas. So, that’s what made me become a writer and I think that’s why I’m an author now.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Richer Than I Ever Been</a> rapper continued, adding, “I knew as a youngster, I never wanted to be a dentist. I never wanted to be a doctor. I never thought about none of that. I knew I would either play football or I would be doing something on my own. And that’s what I did.”</p><p>For more of Ross’ secrets to success, purchase a copy of The Perfect Day To Boss Up: A Hustler’s Guide To Building Your Empire <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6e2pLeMq6asq12dwq670WaYnJmUmrqqr4ysq6utl5y5pr%2BMamlsbGZpg3SFk2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
