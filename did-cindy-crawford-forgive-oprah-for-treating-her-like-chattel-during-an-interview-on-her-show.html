Featuring interviews with the likes of Beyoncé, Whitney Houston, and Michael Jackson, the show continues to influence pop culture discourse over a decade since it concluded its daytime TV run. But it's not just its most iconic moments that keep popping back up.</p><p>From that awkward interview with the Olsen twins, where Oprah repeatedly prodded them to discuss their size while they were battling an eating disorder, to that bizarre sit-down with Top Gun star Tom Cruise, plenty of regrettable interviews from the show have resurfaced over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oprah-winfrey-in-a-shiny-suit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet another regrettable interview that’s come back to haunt Oprah is her 1986 sit-down with supermodel Cindy Crawford. Then just 20 years old, Crawford was yet to become one of the most renowned supermodels in history, and was making her debut appearance on the show alongside her Elite Modeling Agency rep, John Casablancas.</p><p>In a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> resurfaced clip from the show</a>, Oprah introduces Crawford to the audience, before posing a few questions about her career. Curiously, the now 69-year-old opted to direct most of her questions to Casablancas. “So did you have to groom her?,” she inquired. “Did she always have this body? This is unbelievable.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>David Letterman Once Told Oprah That Jay Leno Is 'The Most Insecure Person I've Ever Known'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oprah then prompted Crawford to “stand up just a moment,” presumably so the audience can get an eyeful of her because “no one saw [her] come in standing up.” After Crawford nervously acquiesced to the odd request, Winfrey then remarked, “Now this is what I call a body!”</p><h2 id=cindy-crawford-called-out-oprah-winfrey-for-treating-her-like-chattel-during-their-1986-interview>Cindy Crawford Called Out Oprah Winfrey For Treating Her Like Chattel During Their 1986 Interview</h2><p>After blatantly asking Crawford to show off her body on national television, Winfrey proceeded to redirect her attention to Casablancas yet again. “So did you have to do anything with her?,” she inquired. “Did she have to go to that training period or no?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cindy-crawford.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“With Cindy, in terms of looks it was very easy it was much more psychologically she was not sure she really wanted to model. She didn’t see, I think as clearly as we did the potential that she had. So it’s been a very slow process… little by little, her ambition is growing,” Casablancas responded. “She's getting a sense, and I'm saying it now on this program, if she wants to she can be number one in the business.”</p><p>Though Crawford tried to interject with her own perspective on her career, Winfrey seemed intent on having Casablancas speak on her behalf.</p><p>Crawford would look back on the interview decades later on an episode of Apple TV’s Super Models, where she’d call out Winfrey for asking her to show off her body on national television.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-cindy-crawford-ever-forgive-oprah-for-treating-her-like-chattel-during-an-interview-on-her-show_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was like the chattel or a child, be seen and not heard,” she said. “When you look at it through today’s eyes, Oprah’s like, ‘Stand up and show me your body.

"For some reason I caught the professor's eye, and he was like, 'Honey, I think you have the wrong class.' And that made me so mad, because it was really the first time in my life that I felt judged by the way that I looked,” she continued. “I think it was really important to me, especially then, for people to hear what I have to say and to represent myself as someone who has a brain."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmLavsNhmmquZp5u8s7CMn6arn5mrsm67z6uYoWWWpL9uwNGemK2hnpx6qbHRZqOio5VisKmt062cpWWUqr%2BqusZmoKeslafDqrHWZqanZZiav26%2Fx6iuaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
