Jennifer Lawrence found her other half in Cooke Maroney when they initially met through a close friend.
The pair, who started dating in June 2018, were introduced to each other through mutual pal Laura Simpson, and it wasn’t long before things escalated.
“Things between them are very serious,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly in January 2019 about the actress and the art gallerist.
The following month, Us confirmed that the duo were engaged after the Hunger Games star was spotted wearing a large diamond ring."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Is he nice? Is he kind?’ … I don’t know. It’s just this is The One, I know that sounds really stupid but he’s just, he’s, you know. He’s the greatest person I’ve ever met, so I feel very honored to become a Maroney,” she gushed at the time.</p><p>Lawrence <a href=#>wasn’t thinking about getting engaged to anyone until she met Maroney</a>.</p><p>“I definitely wasn’t at a place where I was like, ‘I’m ready to get married,’” she noted. “I just met Cooke and I wanted to marry him.

Like, Cooke’s biggest joke with me, he’s like, ‘Oh, you want to go directly back to the apartment, babe?’ Or like, ‘Oh no, you have to stay in bed again today,'” the Joy star joked on Dear Media’s “Absolutely Not With Heather McMahan” podcast in October 2020.</p><p>Scroll down to relive Lawrence and Maroney’s epic romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a6zaKdnqpdoa64vsSnmp5lmKrAo63NnWScp5%2Bgsm65wKump52pqHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMraCmnZyeu6Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
