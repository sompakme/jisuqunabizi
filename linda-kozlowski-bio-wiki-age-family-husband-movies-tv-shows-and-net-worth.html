She played “Miss Forsythe” on Broadway in Death of a Salesman and in 1984 took the same role in the film version of 1985.</p><p>Her big break came in 1986 when she was cast as the female lead, opposite Paul Hogan, in the Australian film Crocodile Dundee, during the filming of which their on-screen chemistry resulted in a real relationship. In 1987, Kozlowski was nominated for a Golden Globe award in the Best Supporting Actress category for her performance as Sue Charlton. Two years later, she revisited her starring role with Hogan in Crocodile Dundee II. Also in 1988, she starred with Bill Paxton, Tim Curry, and Annie Potts in Pass the Ammo and the TV miniseries Favorite Son.</p><p>Since that time, she has appeared in Almost an Angel in 1990, Backstreet Justice (with Paul Sorvino) and The Neighbor (with Rod Steiger) in 1994, and Village of the Damned in 1995. In 2001, she starred again with Hogan in Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.</p><p>She has largely left the acting business because of dissatisfaction with the roles she was gaining, stating: “These straight-to-video, schlocky films I was getting were giving me an ulcer, basically because I was the only one on the set that cared about anything… Between that and my biological clock, I decided to give it all away.”</p><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Linda Kozlowski</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-linda></span><span>Who is Linda?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kozlowski is an American former actress.
