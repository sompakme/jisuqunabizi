We all deal with different levels of stress, anxiety and worry. Sometimes it’s because of a quickly-approaching deadline, sometimes it’s a health scare, sometimes it’s finances and sometimes it’s simply a daily struggle with no tangible reason at all."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sometimes it’s because of a quickly-approaching deadline, sometimes it’s a health scare, sometimes it’s finances and sometimes it’s simply a daily struggle with no tangible reason at all. Another thing we all have in common? We want that stress, anxiety and worry to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">go away</a>!</p><p>There are many avenues one can try to bring about some calm vibes, from therapy, to self-care rituals, to supplements, to meditation. If you want an extra boost that can last all day long, however, we recommend considering an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">essential oil diffuser bracelet</a>. You read that right. This wearable stress-buster could majorly soothe you — and it will look so pretty on your wrist!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">AURA Lava Rock Anti-Anxiety Bracelet with Lavender Essential Oil</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, February 26, 2021, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This bracelet</a> is made of pink zebra jasper beads and contrasting black lava beads — and it has a small metallic charm for an elegant accent. Black lava beads are known for relieving anxiety and stress, and some even believe they help with PMS symptoms. Here, they’re even more useful, as you can take the included sample bottle of lavender essential oil and apply a few drops to them. They’re porous, so they will work beautifully to diffuse the soothing scent!</p><p>The pink zebra jasper beads aren’t only there for show. Zebra jasper is actually believed to improve skin, bones and teeth while potentially alleviating muscle spasms. Jasper is also a very calming stone and may bring about contentment and compassion. Plus, it’s known to stimulate the root chakra to keep you grounded.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">AURA Lava Rock Anti-Anxiety Bracelet with Lavender Essential Oil</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24</a> at Amazon!

It also comes packed in a nice box, so it really is a great <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> all around if you’re looking for a unique, thoughtful present with some potentially major benefits. Shoppers felt a calming effect so quickly after applying the lavender oil to the lava beads, and just having a pretty bracelet on your wrist could bring a smile to any jewelry lover’s face!</p><p>We would recommend<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> this bracelet </a>any time, any year, but we really think it’s especially a great choice this year.
