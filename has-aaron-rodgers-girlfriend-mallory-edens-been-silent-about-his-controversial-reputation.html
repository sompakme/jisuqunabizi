She wrote about the fear that she felt during this time and said, "I’ve spent a lot of time lately thinking about the kid who woke up in that hospital bed, terrified she would never run a lap around a track or read a book again. How scary it was to lose everything I thought I knew about myself at that age in the blink of an eye."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/are-zach-wilson-and-aaron-rodgers-friends-despite-not-living-up-to-his-reputation-the-jets-qb_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Are Zach Wilson And Aaron Rodgers Friends Despite Not Living Up To His Reputation As The Jets' QB?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There's a lot to know about the relationship between Zach Wilson and Aaron Rodgers now that they are both members of The New York Jets.</span><p><strong>Facts About Mallory Edens:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Instagram: @malloryedens</strong></li><li><strong>225,000 followers</strong></li><li><strong>created the production company Little Ray Media</strong></li></ul><p>Mallory Edens is doing better now, though, and her injury seems to have completely healed. A few years ago, she was interviewed by TMZ Sports and was asked about her modeling goals.</p><p>Edens said, "I would love to walk for Chanel. I think Coco Chanel was one of the worst, just so bada** female entrepreneurs. She built an incredible empire for herself. I finished the French curriculum at my high school really early." She added that in her last high school year, she researched Chanel. It sounds like she loved learning about her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not always fun to be in the spotlight, especially when someone becomes more well-known because of who their parents are. Since she is famous for being the daughter of the co-owner of the Bucks, Mallory Edens has been a public figure for a while now. However, she seems comfortable with her place in the spotlight. Whenever she gave interviews in the past, she was warm and polite. It seems like if she wants to comment on her romance with Aaron Rodgers, she will. Perhaps she is waiting for the right moment... or maybe she will decide that she doesn't want to say anything at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYmqqfo3qzu8OgnKurXZy2s7jFq6CeppRiuqK4y6ipsmWVmbKvv4ysoKWdnql6oq7Orqtmm5%2BjwbO71Z6prKGRoXqzsc%2Buq5qsmaS7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
