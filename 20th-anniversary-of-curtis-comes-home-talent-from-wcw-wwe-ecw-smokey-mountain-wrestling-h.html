Hildebrand was from the Pittsburgh area and talent such as <a href=#>Mick Foley</a>, <a href=#>Bruno Sammartino</a>, Dominic DeNucci and Jim Cornette were on hand for appearances and top talent such as Chris Jericho, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko & Chris Benoit and Shane Douglas competed on the card. In addition to that, the WWF Intercontinental & European Championships were defended in a match between D’Lo Brown and Al Snow with Foley as the special guest ref. The match went to a no decision after Foley locked in a mandible claw on both competitors and Hildebrand made the visible three count. The entire event raised over $20,000 that all performers completely donated their services to honor Hildebrand. It was only weeks after when Hildebrand passed away at the age of 37.
