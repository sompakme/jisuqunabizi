They clashed again in a tag team bout on the January 10 episode of AEW Dynamite. “The Icon” was on the winning side of both matches.</p><p>As previously announced, the legend’s last match will be at AEW Revolution. He and Darby Allin were confronted by The Young Bucks at the end of Wednesday’s episode of AEW Dynamite.</p><p>In January 2023, Sting competed in Great Muta’s final match. They previously reunited in AEW at AEW Rampage: Grand Slam 2022. The two stars wrestled many times throughout their legendary careers, so the former world champion’s praise of Takeshita is especially noteworthy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsbWlpYmLAtbXNoGScmZyhwG63zqemrK2bmnq1rcqeqqGhpJZ6orrOrZ%2Beql2cv6at02akrqyRYravedOhnGalkaC2r7M%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
