"She is still looking for another house. She is staying in the area to not disrupt the kids’ lives.

Her sole focus is the kids,” the source concluded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christine’s decision to stay in the staff quarters comes after months of her refusing to move from the mansion she’s called home since marrying Kevin in 2004. However, a <a href=#>court recently ordered her to vacate the home</a> no later than July 31st. Moving truck were subsequently seen on the property, presumably to move her personal effects to the temporary accommodation.</p><p>After Christine filed for divorce, Kevin made his own filing with the court, noting that she was defying their prenup, which require her to leave the family home within 30 days of filing. Kevin bought the mansion on his own in 1988.</p><p>“Christine has not moved out, despite multiple requests that she do so and despite Kevin’s offers to assist her financially in relocation to a new residence,” <a href=#>his lawyers wrote in court documents</a> .</p><p>“Instead, Christine has taken the position that she will not move out of Kevin’s separate property residence unless and until Kevin agrees to various financial demands,” the filing went on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The prenup also only entitled Christine to a $1 million settlement, despite being married for nearly two decades.</p><p>Kevin later made a request with the court to <a href=#>limit Christine from removing certain items</a> from the Santa Barbara home once she move out, which was later approved by a judge.</p><p>"Christine shall be permitted to remove her toiletries, clothing, handbags and jewelry,” the motion stipulated, but it prevents her from taking "any other items of property including, but not limited to, furniture, furnishings, appliances, and artwork."</p><p>Kevin and Christine’s divorce has not yet been finalized and remains ongoing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp; <a href=#>Ariana Grande & Dalton Gomez Have A Prenup, But Their Divorce Could Still Get Messy</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaknaaeu26vzqyrp52iqHqmxIympq%2Bdo2K2r8DOZqqtmZaberLBwKurnqqjYq%2B2wIyrnJ%2Bto5rAbsDOZqOemaaaenKAlGakoqScnryvecSsq5qslWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
