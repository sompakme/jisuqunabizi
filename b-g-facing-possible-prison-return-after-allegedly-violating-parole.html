On Saturday (March 30), Nola.com reported that the New Orleans native was picked up by authorities in Las Vegas after appearing alongside Boosie Badazz and Gucci Mane for a live performance the month prior. B.G.’s parole officers argue that since both Boosie and Gucci are convicted felons, he’s barred from associating with both artists, per the terms of his conditional release."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, authorities have suggested that the rapper needs to find another occupation, despite his decades-long history of being<a href=#> a tenured recording artist </a>and live performer. “I’m a rapper. That (is) my profession,” the “Bling Bling” creator told his handlers regarding the matter, according to court documents.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Following his release, B.G. took to social media to lament his frustration with not being able to move freely, in spite of serving more than 12 years in federal prison</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-77192369.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s crazy how after paying my debt to society with 12 and a half years of my life, I come home and still ain’t free,”<a href=#> the Cash Money rapper</a> wrote on Instagram this past Friday (March 29). “I been doing everything the right way, and it seems like that ain’t enough.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, adding, “I been going through it behind the scenes and got a muzzle on for the time being, but I’m confident I’ll come out on TOP. I always do.” The 43-year-old ended his message by thanking his fans for their support and well-wishes, concluding, “I really appreciate y’all for staying down #RNS.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See B.G.’s Instagram post below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5d6qHnPqKqsoZKhsm680aKqqKZdp7K1wdGnZJqknJq0prDLsmSvoZ%2BhrrW1zaBkqZmipLmmeZBram1wZmqDc4CO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
