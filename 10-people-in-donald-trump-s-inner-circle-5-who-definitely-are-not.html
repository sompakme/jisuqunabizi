With that in mind, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that Trump has loads of people vying for his attention. Given all the pressure he is under, it makes perfect sense that Trump has put together an inner circle of friends and advisors he trusts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Never one to mince his words, long before Donald Trump truly became a politician he had his fair share of enemies. Of course, now that he is the President of the United States, Trump’s list of adversaries has become a lot longer. With that in mind, it is time to get to this list of 10 people who are in Donald Trump’s inner circle and 5 who definitely are not.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-vince-and-linda-mcmahon><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Inner Circle: Vince And Linda McMahon</span></h2><p>During the late ‘80s, Vince and Linda McMahon’s WWE held two WrestleMania events at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. While that could’ve been the end of their relationship, Donald and the McMahons have remained friends ever since. In fact, Trump is a member of the WWE Hall of Fame and Linda was given a coveted role in his cabinet when she was made the head of the Small Business Administration.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>16 Lesser Known Facts About Vince McMahon’s Upbringing</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-kellyanne-conway><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Inner Circle: Kellyanne Conway</span></h2><p>Hired to be Donald Trump’s campaign manager in 2016, it is clear that the man who would become President trusted Kellyanne Conway to help him cross the finish line. Now one of the few faces in Trump’s White House who has been there from the start, Conway arguably is better at defending him on TV than any of his other employees.</p><h2 id=definitely-not-barack-obama><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Definitely Not: Barack Obama</span></h2><p>Prior to becoming the President himself, Donald Trump seemed to love in taking shots at Barack Obama during his tenure in the White House. Completely different both in terms of their policies and personality, at times it seems like Trump has delighted in doing what he can to erase Obama’s legacy as President.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-hope-hicks><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Inner Circle: Hope Hicks</span></h2><p>Hand-chosen by Donald Trump to deal with reporters during his lengthy campaign, clearly Hope Hicks was valued in that role as she went on to work in the White House. In fact, according to reports Hicks and Trump were so close that he treated her like a daughter. Absent from the White House for the last two years, Hope is set to return which proves how much Donald likes her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-jared-kushner><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Inner Circle: Jared Kushner</span></h2><p>When Donald Trump hired Jared Kushner for a role in his White House, many people may have assumed it would be in a relatively minor role. Instead, Donald has tasked his son-in-law with negotiating Middle East peace, working on the Opioid epidemic, fixing veteran care, and reforming the criminal justice system. If that weren’t enough, Jared also had a key diplomatic role in China and Mexico and he was supposed to reinvent the government itself.</p><h2 id=definitely-not-adam-schiff><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Definitely Not: Adam Schiff</span></h2><p>As one of the most powerful members of the Democratic party in the house, Adam Schiff has used his position to criticize the President far too many times to count. That fact alone makes this pair natural enemies but ever since Schiff talked about Trump’s Ukraine phone call things have gotten much worse.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Melania Trump Is Trying To Promote Positive Social Media</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-rudy-giuliani><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Inner Circle: Rudy Giuliani</span></h2><p>While Donald Trump has several attorneys, both in his role as president and as a private citizen, the relationship he has with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is completely unique. Longtime associates who in some ways seem closer now than at any time in their shared past, Donald continues to ask Rudy to perform important tasks for him.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-allen-weisselberg><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Inner Circle: Allen Weisselberg</span></h2><p>Far from a household name, like most CFOs Allen Weisselberg is someone who largely works behind the scenes. However, Allen is different because he was named the CFO of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts in the year 2000. On top of that, when Donald became president the three men he named co-trustees of the Trump Organization were his two sons and Weisselberg.</p><h2 id=definitely-not-nancy-pelosi><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Definitely Not: Nancy Pelosi</span></h2><p>Back when Nancy Pelosi first became the Speaker of the House, it seemed like she and Donald Trump might be able to have a professional relationship. Oh, how times have changed. Definitely, among Trump’s biggest enemies these days, the two powerbrokers have butted heads repeatedly and they frequently take personal shots at one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-mitch-mcconnell><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Inner Circle: Mitch McConnell</span></h2><p>While there is no doubt that President Trump and Mitch McConnell have very different personalities, they share a lot of the same goals and they have made a successful team. Able to work together on legislation, the appointment and approval of judges, and much more, even when it came to the President’s impeachment trial they coordinated their tactics.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-donald-trump-jr-and-eric-trump><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Inner Circle: Donald Trump Jr. And Eric Trump</span></h2><p>When Donald Trump made his way to the White House, he made the decision to place the business that made him a star into the hands of his sons Donald Jr. and Eric. Even if you completely disregard the familial bond these three men share, the fact that the President placed his namesake empire into Donald Jr. and Eric’s hands says it all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Amazing Facts About President Trump's Plane</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=definitely-not-rosie-o-donnell><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Definitely Not: Rosie O’Donnell</span></h2><p>After Rosie O’Donnell criticized Donald Trump on The View in late-2006, he caught wind of it and one of the all-time great feuds was born. Perfectly willing to insult one another in the most personal ways possible, Trump’s busy schedule has largely put their feud on ice but it only is a matter of time until that changes.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-lindsey-graham><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Inner Circle: Lindsey Graham</span></h2><p>Despite the fact that these two traded barbs during the 2016 Presidential campaign, they’ve become incredibly close allies since those days. Clearly, someone that Trump has come to respect, they golf together and Donald has turned to Lindsey for council before he made several of his presidency’s biggest decisions.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-ivanka-trump><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Inner Circle: Ivanka Trump</span></h2><p>Due to the fact that Ivanka Trump is the President’s daughter, it makes perfect sense that he loves and cares deeply about her. However, Donald certainly has taken his bond with his eldest daughter further than most parents considering he gave her a vaulted position in his White House. On top of that, whenever Trump talks about Ivanka his admiration for her is abundantly clear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=definitely-not-hillary-clinton><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Definitely Not: Hillary Clinton</span></h2><p>During the height of the 2016 Presidential campaign, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were obvious enemies since they were fighting one another for the highest office in the land. However, almost 4 years after Donald became the President-elect he continues to take occasional shots at Clinton which makes it clear their differences run very deep.</p><p>Sources: politico, businessinsider, washingtontimes, vanityfair, newsweek</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Facts About Donald Trump's Relationship With The Clintons</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWgmryxuMRmoKdllKS7orjDZqurrZ2lwG61zaecq2WTnr%2BkuMRmbGavmKR6pbHFoqWirJWhxm6t0Z5kp6ekZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
