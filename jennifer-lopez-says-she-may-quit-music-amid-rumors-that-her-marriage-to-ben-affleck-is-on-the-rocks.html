This is Me... Now is due to come out on February 16. It will be her first album in a decade, and it can be seen as a sort of sequel to her third release, This is Me... Then, which came out over 20 years ago, when she was first going out with Ben Affleck. Her next album is one of the projects Jennifer is the most proud of. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perhaps that's why she wants it to be her last</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>5:05</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Truth About Jennifer Lopez's Alleged 'No Female Flight Attendant' Rule She Has For Ben Affleck">The Truth About Jennifer Lopez's Alleged 'No Female Flight Attendant' Rule She Has For Ben Affleck</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jennifer Lopez's flight attendant rule for Ben Affleck started with her previous marriage, but that isn't the only rule she has for her husband.</p><p>"We try to do stuff that’s very special for the fans and do collector's items and things like that that they can have forever and ever.

The rumors started when the pair were spotted having what seemed to be a heated exchange while on vacation, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the following explanations from a source</a> didn't help their case. "Ben wanted this vacation to be relaxing but Jennifer’s up at 6 a.m. dictating their schedule," the source explained. "She's extremely picky about everything, from maid service to where to eat dinner. Sometimes Ben can't hide his annoyance, and that’s what people were seeing in St. Barts." Work is also apparently something that causes a lot of strain in their relationship, as things have reportedly been tense between them on the set of their movie Unstoppable: The Anthony Robles Story. "They’re both under a lot of pressure to dispel the notion that together they’re box-office poison," the source added. "They have a lot riding on this, and Jennifer is obsessed with every detail and has been bothering Ben." If work is one of the reasons their marriage is suffering, that might be one of the reasons why Jennifer is considering quitting music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even so, it doesn't seem Ben and Jennifer want to stop trying, as they clearly love each other, and if taking a break from working is what they need, it's worth considering.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoylpqmdqmK6osWMqqyirF2iwrS1wmaYpqGUYr%2B2uc6rqmalkae%2Fqq3GnmSbnZ5irqeyy56apGWfo3q1tMRmqaibm6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
