1. I love to dance. Nothing in the world makes me happier.

I love everything about it: the taste, aroma, ritual, the latte art and the social aspect.</p><p>3. Chocolate’s right up there with coffee for me.</p><p>4. During the making of GoldenEye, I broke one of my ribs. It was my own fault. [In a scene], <a href=#><strong>Pierce [Brosnan]</strong></a> was supposed to throw me against the wall. I asked him to throw me harder. The rest is history.</p><p>5. I played a pool hustler in Turn the River. With no prior experience playing pool and very little time to prepare, I had to make a [four-rail] bank shot. To my own surprise — and everyone else’s — I made the shot in the first take!</p><p>6. I studied economics at the University of Amsterdam before abandoning school to travel the world as a model.</p><p>7. Painting is my other passion. I’m inspired by nature’s magnificent colors and the mystery of science.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Famke-Janssen-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me-002.jpg><p>8. My two sisters and four nieces all have blue eyes. I’m the only one with brown eyes.</p><p>9. I was in South Africa earlier this year, filming Redeeming Love. On my days off, I visited a rhino sanctuary called Care for Wild. It changed my life.</p><p>10. I wrote, directed and coproduced 2011’s Bringing Up Bobby, starring <a href=#><strong>Milla Jovovich</strong></a> and <strong>Bill Pullman</strong>.</p><p>11.

I studied writing and literature at Columbia University.</p><p>14. I’m passionate about the environment and work with Green Cross International.</p><p>15. I love dogs. I love all animals. My late dog, Licorice, and I once did a campaign together for PETA.</p><p>16. I proudly serve on the board of the Film Forum in NYC. This year marks its 50th anniversary!</p><p>17. I’m hopeless in the kitchen. I can’t cook to save my life.</p><p>18. During the lockdown in NYC, when stores and museums put boards up against looters, I joined other artists by putting my art on the boards in Soho and at the Whitney Museum. Now I can say I had an exhibition at the Whitney!</p><p>19. I’ve never been drunk in my life.</p><p>20. My favorite artists are Louise Bourgeois and <strong>William Kentridge</strong>.</p><p>21. I’m obsessed with docuseries.</p><p>22. My taste in film ranges from 1930s screwball comedies to 1970s gritty films.</p><p>23. I only wear dresses and skirts. I haven’t worn pants in my private life in years.</p><p>24. One of my proudest career moments was working with <a href=#><strong>Ava DuVernay</strong></a>. I’m inspired by her work, and I admire that she fights for diversity in front of and behind the camera.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25.
