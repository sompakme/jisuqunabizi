A perfect example of that is there is an increased interest in Wilson's relationship with his children.</p><p>As it turns out, many fans who've learned more about Wilson's kids have been shocked by how differently he reportedly treats his children.</p><h2 id=what-is-owen-wilson-39-s-relationship-with-his-son-robert-like>What Is Owen Wilson's Relationship With His Son Robert Like?</h2><p>In the years since Owen Wilson became a star, the popular actor has found himself in a harsh spotlight on more than one occasion. In some cases, that has been for weird reasons like the time <a href=# rel=nofollow>Wilson's brother Luke Wilson lied about him and got banned from the Playboy mansion</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/owen-wilson-with-his-brothers-luke-wilson-and-andrew-wilson.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, there is no doubt that Wilson's love life has made gossip websites and the tabloids pay attention to him in the past. After all, Wilson has dated other stars like Kate Hudson, Gina Gershon, and Sheryl Crow, and he was rumored to have been involved with Demi Moore.</p><p>When Wilson hasn't been dating celebrities, he has gotten involved with three anonymous women he had children with. First off, Wilson welcomed his first child into the world when he was dating Jade Duell in 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/owen-wilson-s-relationship-with-his-sons-is-completely-different-from-the-one-with-his-daughter-he-reportedly-refuses-to-see.jpg><p>Given the name Robert Ford Wilson, Wilson's oldest son is twelve as of this writing, and he reportedly goes by his middle name. From all accounts, Wilson has a close relationship with his eldest son and the pair has been captured on film together many times in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Luke And Owen Wilson Dropped Out Of Ocean's Eleven And Looking Back, We Understand Why</a></span></p><p>Since Wilson became a father, he has talked about his son Ford Wilson multiple times. For example, in 2013 Wilson told E! about the dreams he had for what his eldest son's life would be like as the child grew up.</p><p>"It seems surreal that this tiny human being is now here — and I'm thinking about all the great adventures he has ahead of him." During a separate interview on The Tonight Show, Wilson called Ford Wilson "a little scene stealer". Wilson then elaborated, "He's not, I wouldn't say, a wonderful conversationalist at this point, but he kind of doesn't have to be, he's so cute."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/owen-wilson-carrying-his-son-robert-wilson.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Ford Wilson started to grow up a little, Wilson spoke to Ellen DeGeneres about his son who was 6 years old at the time. According to Wilson, his eldest son seemed like he might have a future in the entertainment industry at that time.</p><p>"Ford seems like he might even be a little stuntman in training." Wilson continued, "He's a big Jackie Chan fan." Wilson then went on to describe Ford Wilson's sense of humor. "Anything Ford says is just the funniest thing ever. And I can make a joke and it's, like, crickets."</p><h2 id=what-is-owen-wilson-39-s-relationship-with-his-son-finn-like>What Is Owen Wilson's Relationship With His Son Finn Like?</h2><p>According to the website Whos Dated Who, Owen Wilson broke up with the mother of his eldest son in 2011. Following that split, Wilson reportedly went on to get involved with a woman named Caroline Lindqvist in 2013.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Owen Wilson's Career Might Be In Trouble After He Lost A Major Netflix Film Alongside Scarlett Johansson</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wilson and Lindqvist split up in 2014, and she gave birth to his second son that same year. Given the name Finn Lindqvist Wilson, Wilson's second son is nine years old as of this writing and will hit double digits in January 2014.</p><p>Since Finn Wilson was born, some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">facts about Wilson's middle child</a> have been revealed. A perfect example of that is an insider reportedly told People that Wilson and his second son weren't living together, but the famed actor still was an involved parent.</p><p>"They are not living together, but Owen is involved. He comes to doctor's appointments and makes sure Caroline is doing well."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/owen-wilson-looking-happy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of insiders talking about Wilson's relationship with his younger son, the actor once spoke to Ellen DeGeneres about Finn Wilson. According to what Wilson told the talk show host, Finn idolized and developed a close bond with his older brother.</p><p>"Ford is very, kind of protective of his, he always calls him — he doesn't even call him by his name, he always calls him his baby brother. I think he likes the fact that he's just about 30 pounds, but that Finn is smaller."</p><h2 id=does-owen-wilson-see-his-daughter-lyla>Does Owen Wilson See His Daughter Lyla?</h2><p>During the late-2010s, Owen Wilson got involved with a woman named Varunie Vongsvirates. After that, Vongsvirates gave birth to Wilson's only daughter, Lyla Aranya Wilson, in October 2018. Before his daguther was born, Wilson reportedly underwent a paternity test.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Are Ben Stiller And Owen Wilson Really Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following Lyla Wilson's birth, it was revealed to the public that Wilson wanted nothing to do with his daughter. Following that revelation, many people found that news to be so surprising that they questioned <a href=# rel=nofollow>if Wilson's fans would abandon the actor</a>.</p><p>While Wilson's career is going strong today, some observers have been fascinated by how differently Wilson treats his daughter from his two sons. In 2019, the mother of Wilson's daughter spoke to The Daily Mail and revealed that Lyla Wilson had zero contact with her father. "Owen has never met Lyla. Never."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/has-owen-wilson-lost-his-fanbase-after-it-came-out-that-he-refuses-to-have-a-relationship-with-his-daughter-lyla_.jpg><p>As Vongsvirates continued to talk to The Daily Mail, she revealed that to Wilson's credit, he supported his daughter financially. That said, Vongsvirates stated outright that has never been her priority. "He helps financially, but it’s never been about that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vongsvirates then went on to talk about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">what she believes Lyla Wilson needs most</a> from the movie star. "Lyla needs a father. It’s ironic how [Owen] keeps getting these father roles, he's playing a father in his new movie, and he's never met his own daughter."</p><p>Since Wilson has never spoken about his daughter publicly, his side of the story has never been revealed. Most notably, there is no way to know why he embraces being a father to his sons while having nothing to do with his daughter aside from sending money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimsJ2eYsSquNKopWarn6PAbr7Om5yrrF2btq%2B6jKucpZmknryvv8eip2avmam1brDArp6hrJWneq3Fy5pkq52WqsCmv4ytpmarlZp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
