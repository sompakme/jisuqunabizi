He’s nice and he’s tall, so right now I’m just having fun. I’m smiling every time I’m with him,” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in May. “<a href=#><strong>Shereé [Whitfield]</strong></a> has coached me through this: just enjoy the moment, Marlo. Have fun, because I’m one who overthinks everything like, ‘OK, are we gonna be together in five years? Well, when are we gonna move in together? Or, what are we doing here?’ So, I’m just having fun.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Marlo-Hampton-Goes-on-Blind-Date-With-Handsome-Chef-in-Real-Housewives-of-Atlanta-Sneak-Peek2.jpg><p>Marlo has appeared on RHOA off and on since season 4, but she didn’t become a full-time Housewife until season 14, which aired last year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Getting the peach meant a lot to me for my fans,” she told <a href=#>E! News</a> in May 2022. “At some point it was depressing just to see everything — ‘Why don’t you have a peach? Give her a peach!’ — to a point where I wanted it to stop, you guys, just stop it. But it just felt so good when I found out I had a peach. I’m like, ‘Yes! My supporters and fans are going to be so happy.’ It was just an amazing feeling and I just feel everything happens at its right time and right now it’s my time.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta airs on Bravo Sundays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSaqpykeqmtzKmrqKZdnLymv4yopWaanJ67pXnDmqueZZmjerO0zppkrKaVlrhuvMSeomg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
