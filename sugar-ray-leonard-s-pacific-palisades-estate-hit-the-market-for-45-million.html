Leonard, godfather to Khloé Kardashian, and wife Bernadette, daughter of Paul Robi, one of the original members of the iconic 1950s and ‘60s band The Platters, purchased the two parcels that comprise the lavish spread back in 1993 for an unrecorded amount."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The property is available through Aaron Kirman, Kirby Gillon, Bryce Lowe and Daniel Milstein of <a href=#>Aaron Kirman Group</a> at <a href=#>Compass</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyond the wrought-iron and glass front door, Old World details abound, from the hand-stenciled groin-vaulted ceiling that caps the entry vestibule to the numerous baronial fireplaces to the eight stone columns that line the sunken living room and look like they could have been ripped out of an ancient Roman ruin. Simple and comfortable, neutral-toned furnishings recede against more eye-catching decorative and architectural flourishes such as heavy-duty wooden ceiling beams, antique floor tiles, castle-esque oil paintings and tapestries, and gigantic, wood-trimmed arched windows and doors that frame mountain and ocean views, according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><p>Several living rooms and a formal dining room accommodate buttoned-up entertaining, while the sunny, professional chef pleasing eat-in kitchen is the heart of the home, along with the cavernous, double-height family room next door. Hung with crimson velvet curtains, a lower-level lounge serves as a screening room complete with a projector and screen that both drop out of the ceiling at the press of a button. Many rooms spill out to the backyard for a relaxed indoor-outdoor lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sequestered behind massive trees and secured behind gates, the stately manicured grounds offer a parking lot-sized motor court, sun-soaked south-facing terraces, great sweeps of lawn bordered by mature plantings, a stunning oval swimming pool, a tree-shaded putting green, and a lighted tennis court.</p><p>The Upper Riviera neighborhood has long attracted showbiz movers and shakers drawn to its temperate coastal climate, sweeping views and convenient access to Beverly Hills. Some of the troves of past and current residents include Rita Moreno, Steven Spielberg, whose home was previously owned by Douglas Fairbanks, Sylvester Stallone, whose former home is next door to Leonard, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (their former home is just behind Leonard’s estate), Whoopi Goldberg, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, Dan Castellaneta (the voice behind Homer Simpson), and convicted-then-released sex offender Bill Cosby.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmasrZeWv26%2BwLJkpZ2fo66zsNJmp5qbmZu2pHnPmqOiq5GZsrR5xKyrmqyVYrWqwIytn55lnZa%2FrLHTZp2oql1pgm65yKWjoqeeZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
