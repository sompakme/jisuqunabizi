So, how do fellow musicians rate this project? Here's a look at what Eminem, Tyler the Creator, Lupe Fiasco, and others have said about Lamar's Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, and what's next for the rap star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eminem-was-left-39-speechless-39-by-kendrick-lamar-39-s-new-album><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Eminem Was Left 'Speechless' By Kendrick Lamar's New Album</span></h2><p>Having come from the same Aftermath Entertainment camp, <strong><a href=#>Eminem </a></strong>is a long fan of Kendrick Lamar. In fact, the pair linked up on a track called "Love Game" back in 2013 on Em's Marshall Mathers LP 2 and co-headlined the NFL Super Bowl halftime show this year. Taking it to Twitter, the Rap God said that the album's made him "speechless" for how good it was.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I got my clarity just studying Eminem when I was a kid</a>. How I got in the studio was all just curiosity. I had a love for the music, but it was curiosity," Lamar told GQ for a 2016 cover story, adding, "The day I heard The Marshall Mathers LP, I was just like, How does that work? What is he doing? How is he putting his words together like that?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lupe-fiasco-calls-kendrick-lamar-39-s-new-album-39-exceptional-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lupe Fiasco Calls Kendrick Lamar's New Album 'Exceptional'</span></h2><p>As the two most significant names in the conscious hip-hop scene, Lupe Fiasco and Kendrick Lamar are constantly battling each other for the top elite emcee. This year though, the Food & Liquor rapper took to Twitter to compliment his fellow rapper, tweeting, "Reporting from Hawaii. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Exceptional work Mr. Lamar."</a></p><p>"In my own words…once again for you [expletives]…I love me some KDot…always have always will," he took to Twitter back in 2020 amidst the comparison's controversy, adding, "Is he a better artist than me? Yes. Is he a better lyricist than me? No. Does he make better songs than me? Yes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lil-durk-thinks-kendrick-larmar-39-s-album-is-top-notch><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lil Durk Thinks Kendrick Larmar's Album Is Top Notch</span></h2><p>As Lamar made his waves with the anticipated new album and even briefly caused Spotify and Apple Music to crash, Lil Durk joined the movement and took to Twitter to share his thoughts on the latest record. According to him, Kungfu Kenny has "just made it scary" for other rap artists to drop an album, as it will be a suicide mission to compete with an elite emcee of Lamar's caliber for a head-to-head, sales-wise or quality-wise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Kendrick Lamar Is Leaving TopDawg Entertainment</a></span></p><h2 id=tyler-the-creator-39-s-favorite-song-from-mr-morale-amp-the-big-steppers><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tyler, The Creator's Favorite Song From Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tyler, the Creator and Kendrick Lamar have a long history of friendship, and they have never been shy about praising each other.

He told XXL, "Because it’s someone at that level still gunning. He’s trying new voices. He’s trying new s**t. He’s still learning. You can tell he was off his phone for a few months."</p><p>Speaking about Lamar's new album, however, the IGOR rapper joined the online conversation on Twitter, citing the chorus of his favorite song off the album featuring Baby Keem, "Savior."
