In bodycam footage obtained by TMZ on Wednesday, May 29, Zolciak-Biermann, 46, could be seen talking to responding officers from the Milton Police Department about the alleged incident, which the outlet says took place in late April.
Citing a court order that allegedly states that Biermann, 38, is allowed in their home but must remain in his portion of the house, the former Real Housewives of Atlanta star told police that she’s sick of her estranged spouse going through her things amid their messy divorce."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I deal with it every single day. Screaming all day. Yelling all day. Losing his mind all day. Taking my belongings. It’s just, enough is enough.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kim-Zolciak-Biermann-Was-Devastated-She-Missed-Kroy-Biermann-Divorce-Hearing.jpg><p>Though officers attempted to speak with Biermann, he refused to come out of the room and denied having his estranged wife’s phone, claiming he didn’t know where it was.</p><p>The reality personality also noted that nothing physical occurred between her and the NFL alum that night, according to the outlet, who also reported that since Zolciak-Biermann couldn’t show authorities a copy of the court order, nothing could be done about the domestic disturbance.</p><p>The incident is just the latest in the ongoing drama between the estranged spouses.</p><p><a href=#>Us Weekly confirmed</a> in February last year that the duo’s Georgia mansion was in foreclosure, and there was an auction slated for the following month. Zolciak-Biermann previously denied that she was having legal trouble in 2022.</p><p>Though the auction was canceled, Truist Bank submitted additional documents to the court in April as a push for the couple to accelerate their repayment plan after defaulting on their mortgage and struggling to find a buyer for their home, according to documents <a href=#>obtained by Us</a> at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A <a href=#>foreclosure notice</a> doesn’t necessarily mean that the <a href=#>Don’t Be Tardy</a> stars and their family would be forced out of their home right away, but it may signify that Truist Bank is upping its legal claim over the outstanding debt.</p><p>Amid the foreclosure drama, Zolciak-Biermann and Biermann’s marriage crumbled. The pair <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in May 2023 after 11 years of marriage. They briefly reconciled but Biermann filed for a second time that August.</p><p>Together, the exes share six children: Brielle, 27, and Ariana, 22, Zolciak-Biermann’s children from previous relationships, whom Biermann later adopted, as well as sons Kroy “KJ” Jr., 12, and Kash, 11, and twins Kaia and Kane, 10.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1ix7C4wqKYpGWTlrmtv4yppqWhk5p6sLqMnqqtqpGjtKawjKGsrJqRo7Fut9GosGaamZq%2Frq3Np2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
