Scott Mitchell was born in Salt Lake City, Utah in January 1968. He played his college football at Utah as a quarterback. He was selected #93 by the Miami Dolphins in the 1990 NFL Draft.

He was injured and replaced by Dave Krieg. Offensive tackle Lomas Brown later admitted to missing a block on purpose that resulted in Mitchell’s injury because Brown was upset with Mitchell’s quality of play.
