I was recently photographed and interviewed in my home by Playboy,” Seymour, dressed in a fuzzy pink sweater and sheer lingerie, wrote. “I open up about my career, my family, feeling better-than-ever at 67 and so much more!”</p><p class=p1>While speaking to the publication, Seymour opened up about feeling more confident and sexy at this stage of her life than she ever has before. “I feel much sexier now than I ever did when I was younger. Then I was like, ‘Oh gosh, I’m supposed to be sexy. What is that?! There’s an enormous freedom in having lived as long as I have,” she explained. “Like my father used to say, I’m comfortable in my own skin.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>In fact, the Emmy winner revealed that she often gets hit on by men half her age! “I said, ‘Oh darn, in another life.’ I find that very flattering,” she admitted. “I mean, usually you’re invisible by this age! I”m not trying to prove anything to anyone. When you’re younger, its all about ‘look at me.’ I’m not trying to get anyone to look at me.”</p><p class=p1>The Auburn beauty also spoke candidly about overcoming professional hardships. “People say, ‘You’re like a phoenix.’ No, I just had a strong role model in my mother,” she said. “Everyone will have challenges. Your natural instinct is to close up your heart and let it eat you up. Do something to help someone. It will heal you. You’ll be like a magnet when you do that. Light to firefly.”</p><p class=p1><a href=#>Click here</a> to read Seymour’s full interview with the magazine!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajmZ6aerSx2Kamrqpdpby0sdJmnaiqXaW5osXBqLBmmaRig3h5z6KaaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
