On the Feb. 16 premiere of MTV’s My Super Sweet 16, Lil Wayne’s daughter Reginae Carter was the star of the show. With a limitless budget, the now 16-year-old went to work on her Atlanta, Georgia bash, called Reginae’s “All White” Sweet 16 Birthday Party. 
Carter is the daughter of the rapper and his high school sweetheart/ex-wife Toya Carter. Lil Wayne has three sons with other women, but since Reginae is his only daughter, she was showered with gifts and so much more on the blinged-out episode."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On the Feb. 16 premiere of MTV’s My Super Sweet 16, <strong>Lil Wayne</strong>’s daughter <strong>Reginae Carter </strong>was the star of the show.

You deserve it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Originally, Toya’s budget for the party was $250,000, but by the time it’s over — with four costume changes for the birthday girl, backup dancers for Reginae’s performance, a $20,000 venue with custom-made additions, food and drinks, and a surprise performance by <strong><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a></strong> — she admits they’ve gone way over.&nbsp;</p><p>“My biggest fear is I don’t want her to be a brat. But she’s a straight A student,” the nervous mom says. “She’s a good kid, she deserves it.”&nbsp;</p><p>To her credit, Reginae made for a fun temporary reality star, throwing out catchphrases like, “Today I am replacing all my drama with diamonds!” as her godfather — music producer and rapper Birdman — took her on a Rolex shopping spree.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>To close out the lavish evening, Reginae was escorted outside the party venue where she awaited her new ride.</p><p>“Daddy, where’s the car?” she asked Lil Wayne.&nbsp;</p><p>“They said my card didn’t go through baby,” he said, laughing.&nbsp;</p><p>When a red BMW rolls out, Reginae is appropriately excited, but when a black and white Ferrari pulls around the corner, the purple-haired princess hits the peak of happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>The ultimate party price tag is never revealed, but considering the brand new Ferrari she received costs close to her mom’s original budget, chances are they broke half a million.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> What did you think of Reginae Carter’s sweet 16?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZxixKLFzZ5km62pqHqlrdSgn62domLBuLuMnJirq12jtqS3yGakoqaRn3q0w8Seq2ZpZmJ%2FcX2Uam5rZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
