These include other films as well as several TV shows. The truth is this veteran actress has long moved on from playing Trinity.</p><p>And perhaps, even more impressive, Moss has also made quite a fortune for herself.</p><h2 id=since-39-the-matrix-39-carrie-anne-moss-has-starred-in-several-successful-films>Since 'The Matrix,' Carrie-Anne Moss Has Starred In Several Successful Films</h2><p>Prior to being cast as Trinity, Moss had a handful of television roles. At one point, the actress even landed a part in Aaron Spelling’s Models Inc. and it came at a time when things were looking dire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I had no money. Zero. I had to get an apartment because I’d just broken up with a boyfriend,” the actress revealed during an interview with Chatelaine. “Somebody told Mr. Spelling, so he advanced me $10,000.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the Spellings' soap was short-lived. Fortunately for Moss, she was cast in The Matrix after several auditions. And once she appeared in the first film, the other jobs started coming.</p><p>“Before that film, I was nobody. Each job I got, I was so excited. Each paycheck I got, I thought, wow, I'm getting paid to act,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress told New York Daily News</a>.</p><p>“But 'The Matrix' gave me so many opportunities. Everything I've done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which 'Matrix' Franchise Movie Has Been The Highest Grossing?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For instance, since being seen onscreen as Trinity, Moss was cast in Christopher Nolan’s Oscar-nominated mystery thriller, Memento.</p><p>Over the years, <a href=#>she’s also scored roles in films</a> such Chocolat, Pompeii, Silent Hill: Revelation, Snow Cake, Love Hurts, and Suspect Zero. She also starred in TV shows such as Chuck, Vegas, Crossing Lines, and Humans.</p><p>Yet <a href=#>some fans still say Moss' career has been thoroughly mistreated</a>, despite her success.</p><h2 id=carrie-anne-moss-also-became-a-marvel-star>Carrie-Anne Moss Also Became A Marvel Star</h2><p>At some point, Moss also decided to take a break from movies to become a Marvel star after Netflix struck a deal to release some shows from Marvel Television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this universe, Moss was cast to play lawyer Jeri Hogarth in the series Jessica Jones. For the actress, the decision to join Marvel was rather easy from the beginning since she had faith in showrunner Melissa Rosenberg and the rest of the team.</p><p>“I did know right away that these guys [on Jessica Jones] were worth trusting. And that is the key for me,” Moss told Assignment X. “Because then I can do my job. I can find the character and I can explore it, but I don’t have to be worrying that maybe the person has no clue what they’re doing. Which happens."</p><p>Over time, the actress also played Jeri across various Marvel shows for Netflix. First, she made a few appearances in Iron Fist, which, considering her character, made a lot of sense.</p><p>“Carrie-Anne has fast become a fan-favorite part of our street level saga,” Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said in a statement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“As Marvel fans know, Hogarth in the comics plays a critical role in the life of Danny Rand [Finn Jones] so it seems only fitting that Carrie-Anne join in.” Not long after, the actress also appeared briefly in The Defenders.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is unclear if Moss will ever get to reprise her character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe<strong> </strong>at the moment. After seeing Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin in Hawkeye and Charlie Cox’s Daredevil in Spider-Man: No Way Home, however, it’s safe to say that anything is possible.</p><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-where-carrie-anne-moss-rsquo-net-worth-stands-today>Here’s Where Carrie-Anne Moss’ Net Worth Stands Today</h2><p>With all the hard work that she’s done over the years, estimates indicate that Moss is now worth between $3 to $4 million. That’s quite impressive considering her dire financial situation when she started working on The Matrix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I wasn’t paid much money to do The Matrix. It took a year of my life, and I lost my SAG [Screen Actors Guild] insurance because I was working out of the country [in Australia],” the actress revealed.</p><p>“I thought, My God, I’m going to have to wait on tables while I have this huge movie coming out.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Films That Secretly Inspired The Wachowskis To Create 'The Matrix'</a></span></p><p>Thankfully, it didn’t get to that point, more money started coming in for Moss eventually through various acting gigs. Later on, the actress also launched the company Annapurna Living, which offers guided meditation recordings.</p><p>The business certainly has potential for growth, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s not exactly what Moss envisioned for it</a>. “I can’t be GOOP all of a sudden. It’s literally a labor of love,” she told GQ. “It’s not a very smart business venture.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, fans can expect to see Moss next in the upcoming comedy drama Chocolate Lizards. The film also stars Bruce Dern and Thomas Haden Church.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's Why Brad Pitt Doesn't Regret Turning Down 'The Matrix'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqqinrJurc2nnGaln6jAbrrErWSwp6KptW7Azp2Ysmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
