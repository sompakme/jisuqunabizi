His relationship with her led to marriage and it was an uncharacteristically private and low-key romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two never had a cute power couple name like Brangelina or Bennifer and they rarely attended premieres or events together. They really kept their romantic and personal lives to themselves. Nowadays, Reynolds spends a lot of his downtime posting fun details about his life with his wife and kids on Twitter.</p><p>Over the years, some have suggested that the main reason that no Avengers have ever appeared in a Deadpool movie is the breakup of this former celebrity power couple. With a new decade that will feature a Black Widow movie and the release of the third installment of the Deadpool series, people are wondering if there might be some crossover between the two film's casts. They are also wondering just how amicable things are in real life between fellow superheroes, Ryan and Scarlett.</p><p>Here are 15 things that have recently come to light about Ryan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson’s relationship and marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scarlett-was-unprepared-for-marriage><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Scarlett Was Unprepared For Marriage</span></h2><p>They say hindsight is 20-20, and many people refer to saying after relationships fail. Celebrities are no different. ScarJo said in 2014, "I feel I know now more of what I need in a relationship, what I want in a relationship. And I know I have more tools to communicate, not just with my partner, but with myself. That's not necessarily any reflection of who I was married to or what was happening in my marriage, but really where I was in my life."</p><h2 id=their-private-courtship><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Their Private Courtship</span></h2><p>After Ryan Reynolds called off his engagement to Alanis Morrissette and Scarlett called it quits with Josh Hartnett, the two started their relationship in a very private manner. From time to time, they were photographed together, but they never formally acknowledged that they were dating until things got really serious.</p><p>Hitting red carpet events together or making public proclamations of affection wasn’t what they were all about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-engagement><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>The Engagement</span></h2><p>Even though a representative for the pair told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, “they’re both thrilled”, in response to their upcoming nuptials, ScarJo attended the Met Gala solo. It was a bit of an eyebrow-raising moment because Reynolds was filming The Proposal in Boston, which isn’t that far away from NYC, where the Met Gala is held. If he had wanted to attend the event with his fiancée, he probably could have made it work.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things We Just Learned About Scarlett Johansson's Most Iconic Roles</a></span></p><h2 id=the-b-c-wilderness-wedding><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>The B.C. Wilderness Wedding</span></h2><p>Maintaining their private courtship, the two got married at a remote Vancouver, BC wilderness retreat, just four months after their engagement was announced. They were wed with a select guest list of very few friends and family. Ryan and Scarlett wanted to keep their anonymity intact.</p><p>The event was so tightly monitored that not a single bridal gown photo of ScarJo was leaked during or after the September 28th event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-strange-wedding-gift-from-samuel-l-jackson><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Strange Wedding Gift From Samuel L.

While on The Late Show with David Letterman, Reynolds spoke about married life, and the unusual wedding present received from the charming celeb, Samuel L. Jackson. He gave them 10,000 bees.

She explained why she never talked about it. She said, "I would never ask somebody about their marriage if I didn't know them. I don't profess to know anything about marriage that anybody else doesn't know, or how to make it right. I don't want to read about somebody who's giving me relationship advice."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Sweet Pics Of Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds Proving They're Total Couple Goals</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cooking-for-each-other><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Cooking For Each Other</span></h2><p>They say that the eyes are the windows to the soul, but the stomach is the way to a man’s heart.

My face was on the cover of magazines I'd worked very hard to prevent being in."</p><h2 id=no-time-to-work-on-their-relationship><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>No Time To Work On Their Relationship</span></h2><p>Many celebs have talked about how their roles in Marvel movies can be all-encompassing. This was true of Scarlett, who began to feel a distance from her husband when she first took on the iconic role of Black Widow.</p><p>Scarlett said of her marriage, "We have no time for dates. We work and then go home and—I, anyway—just stare at the wall for a few hours before I go to sleep. Like in any profession, it's difficult. You want to make sure you have time to invest in your family. It's a challenge, but it's worth it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=career-competition-tearing-them-apart><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Career Competition Tearing Them Apart</span></h2><p>Rumors of a split came when the two listed their home, but it was reported that this was because they were hoping to move to New York.</p><p>In 2016, Scarlett told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, "The logistics of being with another actor are challenging. There has to be a real understanding of how you share your time, especially when two people's careers are going at the same rate. Or even if one person is more successful than the other, that also proves challenging.
