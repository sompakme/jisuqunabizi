Quite obviously it is preferred if they can be adopted together. A woman spotted the duo and brought them into&nbsp;a local vet office to make sure they were alright.</p><p style=text-align:left><strong class=punchline-large>RELATED: <a href=#>HOW TO KEEP A CAT COOL IN A SUMMER HEATWAVE</a></strong></p><p>They’ve been dubbed "Milo and Otis," just like the famous dog and cat duo from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">classic 80's movie</a>. Otis is the puppy,&nbsp; thought to be a Plott Hound mix, and will not go anywhere without his feline best friend, Milo, a black short-hair kitten. We think that this is such an adorable bond. Unfortunately, the animals have been unable to share the story of how they met and why the kitten had to be carried around, but we imagine it's&nbsp;just as heart-warming as their rescue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An animal officer</a> from Florida’s Okaloosa County Animal Services, Andrea Warren, was sent to pick up the pair from the veterinarians' office to bring them to a shelter. She noticed their cute&nbsp;friendship right away. Warren said, “They sleep together. They play together. They fight together. They eat together. The puppy is just lost without the kitten.” They were taken to the Panhandle Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) cuddling and napping together. They'll go to a temporary foster home first before being placed up for adoption, baring that their owner does not come to pick them up first.</p><p>Together, they will wait patiently for someone to come and adopt them. We have a feeling that these two could find a home pretty quickly because of course there is nothing cuter than baby animals cuddling. Especially a dog and cat, as these two&nbsp;pets have a history of not getting along very well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We hope that Milo and Otis live a long, healthy life together being best friends and that they find their&nbsp;furr-ever home as soon as possible.</p><p><strong class=punchline-large>NEXT: <a href=#>'WHAT THE FLUFF' CHALLENGE IS AN ADORABLE PUPPY PRANK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinrqigrnqstdOtnKdlkprAtXnFq6CeppSoeqKwzqmrZqaVrHqpu8yeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
