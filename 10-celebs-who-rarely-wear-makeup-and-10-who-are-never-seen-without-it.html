We notice their relationship statuses, number 1 music slots, and statement fashion. It doesn't take a detective eye to notice something else, though. All that makeup. Going into the cosmetics business is now one of the most-assured ways to make money. Rihanna's Fenty line is set to out-sell both KKW Beauty and Kylie Cosmetics. Jessica Alba has her Honest line. Kat Von D is dominating Sephora sales. Even Gigi Hadid has a collaboration with Maybelline.</p><p>Makeup has taken a very strange turn, though. The cosmetics industry literally spent decades building up the tool that women and men could use – "no one will ever know" was the biggest selling point. Designed as something to fall back on for a clever cover-up, makeup has been the blemish blessing for generations. It's all changed, though. Having a two-inch, caked-up face all over social media is something that celebrities have taken on with pride. Then again, that doesn't apply to all celebrities. Some famous faces, like Demi Lovato or Mila Kunis, are perfectly happy walking around makeup-free. Others, like Khloe Kardashian or Christina Aguilera are rarely seen without it. We're dividing these 20 celebs into either category. Here are 10 celebrities who are always wearing makeup (plus 10 who are rarely seen wearing any).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=makeup-is-part-of-the-ariana-grande-look><strong>MAKEUP IS PART OF THE ARIANA GRANDE "LOOK"</strong></h2><p>Alongside her record-breaking Sweetener album, Ariana Grande has a lot going for her. This 25 year-old superstar is naturally pretty, and everything about her sends out sweetheart vibes. Make no mistake, though. The over-the-knee boots, slouchy sweaters, and signature high ponytail have a helping hand. It's called makeup. When a Glamour reporter recreated Ariana's look, she went through no less than 20 different products. There is precisely one shot of Ariana 100% makeup-free floating around on the internet. Ariana doesn't cake it on, but she definitely wears makeup regularly.</p><p><strong>"I'm half Glamazon, half Granola Chick," is how Ariana Grande describes herself.</strong></p><h2 id=kendall-jenner-can-take-it-or-leave-it><strong>KENDALL JENNER CAN TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT</strong></h2><p>The most important quality that modeling scouts look for? A naturally photogenic face. Kendall Jenner has admitted that getting accepted into the modeling world was "tough" – in the early days, Kendall was turned away from gigs for being linked to the Kardashians. With 2017 earnings of $22 million, Kendall is now the highest-paid model in the world. You will see Kendall in makeup. Then again, you'll see her hitting the gym or grabbing iced coffee with a 100% makeup-free face. "Less is more," Kendall told W Magazine. The Adidas and Victoria's Secret model always wears sunscreen, but she doesn't always wear makeup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=j-lo-uses-it-to-knock-off-the-years><strong>J-LO USES IT TO KNOCK OFF THE YEARS</strong></h2><p>Take a long hard look at the "perfection" you're seeing here. Jennifer Lopez has more than proved that she can make it (and make it last). This is a 49-year-old superstar who has dominated the music industry for over 20 years. With over 79 million Instagram followers and a sell-out Las Vegas residency, Jen is a mogul. The look doesn't come by itself, though. "11 Beauty Products Jennifer Lopez Always Keeps Backstage" was Allure's story in 2018. "The Vanity" was how the magazine titled one pic of J-Lo's endless backstage products. Jen isn't vain, but she is always made up.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-looks-like-this-naturally><strong>SELENA GOMEZ LOOKS LIKE THIS NATURALLY</strong></h2><p>"My overall health" is what Selena Gomez focuses on – not whether the highlighter powder goes on before (or after) the contouring. The most-followed person on Instagram has 141 million people subscribing to her real vibes, down-to-earth personality, and music and fashion ventures. Considering that Selena is permanently in the spotlight, you'd think she would pull a Kardashian and make sure that she is fully prepped before leaving the house. Instead, this girl splashes around parks in denim dungarees. Here is what Selena wrote on Instagram regarding beauty: "The beauty myth – an obsession with physical perfection...to fulfill society's impossible definition of beauty."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicki-minaj-can-t-imagine-life-without-it><strong>NICKI MINAJ CAN'T IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT IT</strong></h2><p>"I can't see myself without pink lipstick. I can go without it for a couple days, but if there was no more pink lipstick in the world, I'd be useless." This remains one of Nicki Minaj's most famous quotes. The highest-paid woman in hip-hop is the face of 2018 music – if wearing lipstick makes you a "Queen," so be it (in Nicki's books). When it comes to makeup, Nicki is rarely seen without full-on caterpillar lashes, thick foundation, bright lipstick, and those wigs. Then again, Nicki keeps it real. "I like transforming," she told Elle. "It feels good – I do it for the art."</p><h2 id=zendaya-doesn-t-believe-that-ugly-exists><strong>ZENDAYA DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT "UGLY EXISTS"</strong></h2><p>Refreshing celebrities come with refreshing quotes. When Zendaya told Huff Post about the standards that she doesn't "plan on lowering for anybody," she wasn't talking about makeup. Zendaya sees beauty in what's underneath peoples' skin – she doesn't measure it by what you apply to the outside. "Nobody's ugly," Zendaya has been quoted as saying. "That doesn't exist. I say, take the time to get to know who you are, taking the time to love yourself, and everything will be alright." Looking at celebrities who have done that: Zendaya, Jennifer Aniston, Hilary Duff, and Selena Gomez, this girl has a point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-built-a-billion-from-makeup><strong>KYLIE JENNER BUILT A BILLION FROM MAKEUP</strong></h2><p>In 2017, people were mocking Kylie Jenner for saying that she was "like, realizing stuff." Now that this 21-year-old is fronting Forbes magazine as the "youngest self-made billionaire," Kylie's opinions get taken a little more seriously. Not everyone is a fan of Kylie's over-the-top makeup look, though. For some, the repetitive Instagram feed of full-on looks, bold lipsticks, and provocative poses are a bit much. Then again, it wouldn't be Kylie without them. More grounded in 2018, this new mom may be exploring her motherly side, but the makeup isn't going anywhere soon.</p><p><strong>"Makeup is my passion." The Kylie Cosmetics empire has earned Kylie nearly 1 billion dollars.</strong></p><h2 id=demi-lovato-pulls-off-nomakeup><strong>DEMI LOVATO PULLS OFF #NOMAKEUP</strong></h2><p>When you're naturally beautiful, you're naturally beautiful. Dress this girl up or reveal her true raw self, and she'll always shine. Demi Lovato is one of 2018's most-successful singers. Despite having to take some time out to get herself well, Demi is still on our minds, and that power of voice is still on our sound systems. In 2014, Demi launched Devonne by Demi. Unlike Kylie Cosmetics or KKW Beauty, the line is dedicated to caring for skin (as opposed to dressing it up). Think clarifying mud masks over contouring kits. Demi has famously said: "Your imperfections make you beautiful." We don't see many here, Demi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-k-turns-a-different-shade-every-day><strong>KIM K TURNS A DIFFERENT SHADE EVERY DAY</strong></h2><p>Kim Kardashian is a woman who needs no introduction. Her extensive range of KKW Beauty products, though – that's a different matter. It's hard work just keeping up with the latest KKW Beauty drop. The #UltralightBeams have just dropped. We're not entirely sure how the Ultralight Beams differ from everything else Kim's cosmetics range offers, although the accompanying Instagram caption helps: "Loose Powder in Lavender. Use alone for a shimmering glow or mix it with water or a mixing medium for a super pigmented, one stroke high metallic finish." Kim makes millions from makeup, and leaving the house without it isn't something that we see often.</p><h2 id=emma-watson-is-never-caked-up><strong>&nbsp;EMMA WATSON IS NEVER CAKED-UP</strong></h2><p>Emma Watson may as well have "no time wasters" as her slogan. In 2011, Emma was wrapping up Harry Potter. In 2018, Emma has her opinions listened to at the United Nations, and she isn't talking about makeup. While Emma has been the face of both Chanel and Burberry, covering herself in cosmetics isn't how Emma rolls. The natural face that gets a slick of lipstick at the most is exactly what we see in Emma's wardrobe – always classy,&nbsp;and always original. $60 million may be what Emma earned from the Harry Potter franchise, but spending it all at Sephora isn't on her agenda.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-aguilera-challenges-naturally-beautiful><strong>CHRISTINA AGUILERA&nbsp;CHALLENGES NATURALLY "BEAUTIFUL"</strong></h2><p>It remains Christina Aguilera's biggest song to date. "Beautiful" was a track that defined 2000s pop. While the lyrics inspired millions of fans to believe that "I am beautiful, no matter what they say," the songstress herself seems to have her own rulebook. In 2018, Christina bared all on the cover of Paper. Without a speck of makeup, she showed the world a fresh face (complete with the freckles we never knew she had). Christina called the experience "liberating." The singer and reality judge confessed that she would quickly return to her standard look of heavy rouge, lashes, and burlesque finishes.</p><h2 id=gigi-hadid-lets-the-style-do-the-talking><strong>GIGI HADID LETS THE STYLE DO THE TALKING</strong></h2><p>2018 has been the year of model squads. Kendall Jenner would probably get lonely sitting on that throne alone. Thank goodness for Gigi Hadid, the rising "it" girl. Gigi is now the face of Fendi, Reebok, and Tommy Hilfiger. Part of Gigi's job is to wear makeup – you don't have much choice on the runway. In her downtime though, Gigi wears casual or offbeat looks (and not much makeup). Gigi's Coachella outfits have been super chilled, and her gym wardrobe is likewise casual. FYI, this girl is a fierce boxer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I think that not being perfect has given me the freedom to keep getting better," Gigi Hadid once said.</strong></p><h2 id=rihanna-flies-the-flag-for-fenty><strong>RIHANNA FLIES THE FLAG FOR FENTY</strong></h2><p>When you're running an empire in 2018, you do your own advertising. Kim K is Kanye West's walking Yeezy billboard. Kylie Jenner takes matters into her own hands. With Rihanna set to out-sell both KKW Beauty and Kylie Cosmetics, this international mogul has it in her interest to wear makeup. RiRi generally doesn't overdo it, but then again, she rarely "under-does" it. Fenty Cosmetics is the latest sensation to hit shelves, and the 40+ shades offer something for everyone. Rihanna is also a major sports face with Puma. Not surprisingly then, Rihanna keeps the makeup to a reasonable level. Still, it's there...</p><h2 id=emilia-clarke-shows-us-her-natural-self><strong>EMILIA CLARKE SHOWS US HER NATURAL SELF</strong></h2><p>Here's something interesting about major fashion and beauty brands. They choose natural beauty. Now the face of Dolce & Gabbana's fragrance, Emilia Clarke is just one more star who has been cherry-picked for not wearing a ton of makeup. The Game of Thrones actress was always a woman of principles – being "somebody's wife and somebody's girlfriend" was not how she wanted her career to go, according to LA Times. Whether she is single, dating, married, or cuddling a dog though, Emilia won't be listing makeup as "things to save if my house is on fire." Silvery locks, yes. A ton of makeup, no.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khloe-kardashian-hides-her-natural-self><strong>KHLOE KARDASHIAN HIDES HER NATURAL SELF</strong></h2><p>Even if she wanted to, Khloe Kardashian would probably have a hard time staying away from makeup. With two sisters conquering the cosmetics world, there is probably rarely a day in the Kardashian household that doesn't revolve around powders, potions, lotions, and Lip Kits. Still, when you're a 34 year-old mom, you can make your own decisions. Khloe chooses this – a very "social media" look that showcases glowing cheekbones, contoured features, and a possible touch of editing. Of course, the Koko x Kylie collection means that Khloe is cashing in on the industry.&nbsp;Khloe is rarely seen without her "done-up" face.</p><h2 id=mila-kunis-prefers-world-of-warcraft><strong>MILA KUNIS PREFERS WORLD OF WARCRAFT</strong></h2><p>Not many celebrities can pull off a paparazzi shot of them at the ball game with confidence. They either sit court side in all kinds of designer clothes, or they come equipped with a ton of makeup. Mila Kunis sees things differently. The Friends With Benefits actress frequently tops "most beautiful" lists. In an interview with The Metro, Mila recalled arriving in the US as a child– her family had just $250 to their name. Likely reflecting Mila's ability to see the real problems in life, her opinions literally say: "I couldn't care less."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Wear makeup, don't wear makeup. Do what makes you feel good," says Mila Kunis.</strong></p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence-wears-more-than-before><strong>JENNIFER LAWRENCE WEARS MORE THAN BEFORE</strong></h2><p>Remember the Jennifer Lawrence we fell in love with in The Hunger Games? She came splattered in mud with brown hair and something we actually respected – sheer talent. While that talent hasn't gone anywhere, we can't help but notice that the look has changed. J-Law is still the out-spoken, quirky celebrity who opens interviews with: "Why can't I say anything normal?" When it comes to looks though, Jen seems to have settled for Hollywood's "new normal" – a ton of makeup. Fortunately, Jen's recent interview regarding pizza is down-to-earth.&nbsp;If she wants a piece of pizza, she'll "have a piece of pizza."</p><h2 id=gal-gadot-wears-as-little-as-ever><strong>GAL GADOT WEARS AS LITTLE AS&nbsp;EVER</strong></h2><p>Gal Gadot's social media posts show her wearing virtually no makeup. In fact, for many shots, it's zero makeup. The Wonder Woman actress does have a contract with Revlon – there's no way out of makeup with that one. Then again, it's Gal's "real-life superhero" vibes that have landed her a Reebok contract worth a reported $10 million, according to Page Six. For those shots, and for the Gal we know, it's straight-up natural beauty. Having served two years' military service in her native Israel, this is an actress who knows boots and dust. Gal brings that fighter attitude to her roles, and she doesn't need makeup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lady-gaga-s-life-is-a-makeup-carousel><strong>LADY GAGA'S LIFE IS A MAKEUP CAROUSEL</strong></h2><p>Slapping Lady Gaga with the "always wears makeup" label should be done very carefully. The "Born This Way" singer might have outlandish outfits and statement rouge as her trademark look, but Gaga has been showing us more of her real self lately. Now that A Star Is Born is out, the lens on Gaga is sharply focused. This is a look we see a lot of. Then again, hop over to Lady Gaga's Instagram, and you'll see refreshing, makeup-free beauty. In 2016, the Joanne singer celebrated her 30th birthday with a 100% makeup-free snap of herself with a slice of cake.</p><h2 id=simple-does-it-for-scarlett-johansson><strong>SIMPLE DOES IT FOR SCARLETT JOHANSSON</strong></h2><p>The last major interview that Scarlett Johansson gave on beauty or makeup was back in 2015. You're looking at a Marvel superhero actress who has far more important things to focus on. Grueling training regimes for Scarlet's Black Widow roles are all the preparation this actress needs– playing around with a zillion eyeshadows just isn't Scarlett. Natural beauty has been an asset for Scarlett from day one. Now, it's earning her $25 million for a standalone movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You likely have opinions on these 20 ladies.
