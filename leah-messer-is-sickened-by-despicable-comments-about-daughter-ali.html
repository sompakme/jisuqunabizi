The West Virginia native <a href=#>revealed the following year that Ali had developmental delays</a>. The little one’s rare form of muscular dystrophy is degenerative and will progress as she gets older, eventually confining her to a wheelchair.</p><p>Messer, who also shares daughter Adalynn, 7, with her ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Jeremy Calvert</strong></a>, told Us Weekly exclusively in April 2019 <a href=#>how Ali’s sisters support her</a>.</p><p>“[My daughters are] there for each other,” she shared at the time. “They’ll help each other.

She’s in things, then Ali’s in things. We just found a way.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ali is “doing great,” she said. “We just went to Columbus and she had a wonderful appointment. She told her therapist, ‘My heart is great, I passed all my tests. I did an amazing job.’”</p><p>When it comes to <a href=#>coparenting while quarantining</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic, Messer and her exes are “doing great,” she told Us last month.</p><p>“Jeremy and I have a different relationship than Corey and I, but we still all coparent well and, at the end of the day, the kids are our first priority all the time,” the MTV personality explained to Us in April.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalnZGdeq6x0qycq2WZqHq0tcKknKedlGKvunnDnqqpoZOWr62xjJympqWVo8G0ecCbpq6sXZmutrPHrZyrZZGhtnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
