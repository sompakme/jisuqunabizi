Doja Cat debuted her most over-the-top glam to date at the Schiaparelli spring/summer 2023 show during Haute Couture Week on Monday, January 23. 
The “Say So” artist, 27, stepped out in head-to-toe red paint that was covered with crimson Swarovski crystals. The shimmering jewels adorned every inch of Doja’s body including her eyelids, lips, chest and arms. The head-turning beat was brought to life by Pat McGrath, who used over 30,000 gems via hand-application."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Grammy winner accessorized with a fiery stole and dangling earrings. On her feet, the hitmaker wore coral-colored knee-high boots. The footwear also commanded attention as the vamp was made to resemble an open-toe design.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Doja is no rookie when it comes to debuting daring glam.

The “Streets” songstress also sported bold red lipstick and had her arms coated in black ink. As for her outfit, Doja donned a sexy black cutout dress. Days later, the rap star donned an airbrushed gold look to attend the A.W.A.K.E. presentation.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When trolls slammed her glam as “ugly,” Doja was quick to clap back. “I wasn’t trying to look sexy or attractive,” she wrote via Twitter at the time. “All of my makeup has a story and there are absolutely zero rules and if there were, you wouldn’t be the one making them.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Doja has been known to push beauty boundaries with her hair too. In August 2022, she <a href=#>unveiled a buzz cut and shaved brows</a> while chatting with fans on Instagram Live.&nbsp;“I was never supposed to have hair,” the “Woman” singer told her followers. “I don’t like having hair. I never liked having hair. I cannot tell you one time since the beginning of my life that I’ve ever been like, ‘This is cool.’ I just do not like to have hair.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to get all the details on Doja’s red glam at the Schiaparelli show:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvDqKGaZZOWwW7DxJqprGVjZX1xfIyrnJ1lk6fGtMDApapmmaRiwKS0yJqnmqqVobmqedKhprBloJ28tbvSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
