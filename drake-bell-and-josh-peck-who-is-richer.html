But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who has built a higher net worth</a>: Drake or Josh?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on September 3, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> Nickelodeon's Drake & Josh was easily one of the biggest shows. While the series paid both actors quite well, their current net worths are nowhere near comparable. Josh Peck takes the win with a whopping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $9 million</a>, which he amassed through the success of his YouTube and social media presence. As for Drake Bell, he comes in with a measly net worth of $600,000. Bell encountered many financial woes throughout his career, including filing for bankruptcy in 2014. Things only went downhill for Drake following his arrest this past summer due to child endangerment. Following his July 12, 2021 hearing, Drake Bell has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sentenced to 2 years probation.</a></p><h2 id=who-is-richer-drake-bell-or-josh-peck>Who Is Richer: Drake Bell Or Josh Peck?</h2><p>It comes to nobody's surprise that Josh Peck is the richer star out of the two, having made most of his recent income from his successful YouTube career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The New York native has accumulated an incredible 345 million views since making his debut on the video-sharing platform back in 2017, with an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">income upwards of $420,000 a year</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>Of course, this doesn’t include any sponsored deals and partnerships Peck may sign to promote and endorse products in his videos, which can easily earn him another $50,000 for a simple shoutout to his millions of subscribers. Peck’s YouTube videos currently average anywhere between 200k-300k while his videos such as his reunion with former co-star Miranda Cosgrove, along with his wedding special, having piled up over five million views.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Mean Creek star also has 11.5 million followers on Instagram, and if you know a thing or two about sponsorships, you’d be well aware of the fact that the more people that are following a specific account, the more money they can demand from companies who are interested to promote their products on their page.</p><p>It’s believed that Peck’s net worth has skyrocketed to $9 million thanks to YouTube and Instagram while his acting career is still going strong with recent projects including the TV series including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Grandfathered.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Nickelodeon's Drake Bell And Josh Peck Still Friends?</a></span></p><h2 id=drake-and-josh-39-s-falling-out>Drake And Josh's Falling Out<strong></strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bell, on the other hand, hasn’t been too lucky with his income, which is surprising since he would probably be just as successful as Peck if he was to dedicate his time to creating a YouTube channel of his own. To date, the 35-year-old has released four albums, which didn't go on to do too well, so much that in February 2014, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was forced to file for bankruptcy</a> after ending up with over $581,000 in debt, according to TMZ.</p><p>Drake went on to experience major financial woes, which left him with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $600,000</a>, which obviously isn’t anywhere near the numbers Peck has amassed, but at least he’s no longer bankrupt. His money troubles weren't the only thing going awry for Drake. The star was left out of Josh's wedding party, leading to an online rant that led the two to fall out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily for the two, they reunited on Peck's YouTube channel back in 2017, squashing the beef the two had, especially when it came to Drake not receiving an invite to Josh's nuptials. Although things were finally getting back to normal for Bell, he found himself having problems with the law!</p><h2 id=drake-bell-arrested>Drake Bell Arrested</h2><p>As if things weren't bad enough for Drake Bell, the former Nickelodeon star was arrested on child endangerment charges earlier this summer. In June 2021, the actor and singer pleaded guilty via Zoom to felony charges of "attempting to endanger children and a misdemeanor charge of disseminating material harmful to juveniles," says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline.</a></p><p>The sentencing occurred back on July 12, where Drake was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sentenced to 2 years probation</a>, ultimately avoiding any prison time. All of this came as quite a shock to fans, who idolized the star growing up.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Former Nickelodeon Star Admitted To Crushing On Jim Carrey</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibq5mbmnqjsculZJqmlGK3sL%2FHZqeem5tixKm7jKKqZqqZmLWmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
